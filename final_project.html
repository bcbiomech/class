<h1 class="title toc-ignore">Final Project</h1>

</div>


<p>The last part of the course is devoted to a single team-based
independent project that combines the conceptual knowledge from lecture
with the data analysis and report-writing skills from the 5 MPs. Your
team should work with Prof. K to develop an interesting question with a
reasonable scope to answer with your Final Project. There are two
assignments associated with the final project: A report and short
presentation.</p>
<div id="project-guidelines" class="section level1">
<h1>Project Guidelines</h1>
<div id="general-advice" class="section level2">
<h2>General Advice</h2>
<p>The most important point to consider while undertaking your FP is
this: pose an informed question (i.e., an hypothesis) and address it
quantitatively with the data you collect. Beyond this, you must also
explain why you asked the question you have, that is, establish what
about this question is relevant about to the biology and physics
underlying your hypothesis. To successfully pose a manageable question
and realize its importance, it is critical to choose a topic or problem
that is tidy and focused. In doing so, you can address it in enough
detail in your report and presentation.</p>
<p>To understand what is important about your question and, just as
importantly, establish how you’ll get your data (i.e., design your
experiment), you must evaluate how similar questions have been answered
and what the answers were. In other words, you must review the
literature. The introductory and discussion material of your reports and
presentations should include information gathered from the literature
that address why the work is important and how your work contributes to
new knowledge. Prof. K will work with you to review the appropriate
literature.</p>
<p>Once you have a good idea of how to approach your problem and in what
context it might land, you’re now ready to do some science. Your
experimental subjects need not be human, but they must permit easy data
acquisition—you only have a few days to collect these. Experiments
should leverage the skills and technical knowledge you obtained in
class, including biomechanical modeling in R, kinematic analysis in
imageJ, and data acquisition with Arduino. Of course, critical to your
choice of methodologies is the instrumentation you can access: wind
tunnel, three-point tester, force transducers, calipers, iPhones and all
the software used with these. In choosing what instrumentation and
software to use, you must understand what data you want to gather.
Therein, as the Bard would say, lies the rub. Think critically about
this and consider how your data will perform in answering your question.
A list of resources available to you can be found <a
href="5380.resources.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="project-timeline" class="section level2">
<h2>Project Timeline</h2>
<p>We’ll break from lecture activities in late April to begin thinking
about the final project. On Wednesday, April 21st, and Friday, April
23rd, we’ll hold a round table to discuss potential projects, including
their scope and logistics. After this, you’ll have approximately three
weeks to complete the project and submit your presentation and another
week after that to complete and submit the project report. Please have a
look at our <a href="schedule.html">schedule</a> page for more
details.</p>
<p>After the round tables, each team will be required to schedule at
least one meeting with Prof. K to discuss relevant literature and
perhaps collaborate on experiments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="final-project-report" class="section level1">
<h1>Final Project Report</h1>
<div id="report-guidelines" class="section level2">
<h2>Report Guidelines</h2>
<p>Just like the MPs, the Final Project report should resemble a short
manuscript that models a scientific paper. By this, we mean that it
should contain appropriate headings or sections framing the question,
how it was answered, the results, and how these results relate to the
question and similar work that has been done. Like the <a
href="mini_projects.html#ReportGuidelines">MP reports</a>, these
sections include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction: One or two paragraphs that proclaim the motivation for
the work and prepares readers for the structure and outcomes described
in the report.</li>
<li>Methods: One or two paragraphs that detail how the question was
answered and how one could reproduce the experiments presented in the
report.</li>
<li>Results: One or two paragraphs that summarize the results. This
section should reference at least one figure produced through your
analysis in R.</li>
<li>Discussion: Once or two paragraphs that briefly discuss the
importance of the results (i.e., how they relate to the main question
and the field in a broader context).</li>
<li>Author Contributions: A paragraph that briefly state the
contributions made by each team member to the project.</li>
<li>References: A bibliography section that includes the works cited in
the text.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please synthesize your results into a report 5 pages long using R
markdown. Each group should submit on document containing the markdown
code and a second document rendered in R markdown. These should be
emailed to Professor Kenaley. The R markdown document should look
something like a scientific paper, perhaps like one you read in your
literature review. It should include the following sections and their
associated content:</p>
<p>The very prestigious Nature publishing group has released a series of
articles on their “Scitable” site devoted to writing in science. You may
find <a
href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/118519636#bookContentViewAreaDivID">this
article</a> helpful in writing your report.</p>
</div>
<div id="author-contribution-evaluations" class="section level2">
<h2>Author Contribution Evaluations</h2>
<p>As with the mini-projects, <strong>EVERY</strong> group member of
each team must submit an evaluation of their teammates’ contributions to
the final project. These evaluations can be made using <a
href="https://forms.gle/1CMXtch2feruGxoX9">this form</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Team members who do not submit their peer
evaluations before the deadline will be subject to a 5-point penalty for
each 24-hour period the assessment is not submitted. For example, if an
evaluation is submitted 12 hours late, this will mean a 5-point penalty;
for one that is 36 hours late, this will mean a 10-point penalty.</p>
</div>
<div id="report-rubric" class="section level2">
<h2>Report Rubric</h2>
<p>The FP report is worth a total of 100 points toward your final grade.
The following rubric describes how it will be evaluated.</p>

<div id="final-project-presentation" class="section level1">
<h1>Final Project Presentation</h1>
<p>Each team will make a 10-minute presentation using the software of
their choice. The content of the presentation should be a distillation
of project paper, however, it should be visually pleasing and not just a
bunch of text. More specific guidelines and advice for composing the
presentation can be found at this nifty <a
href="https://www.nature.com/scitable/ebooks/english-communication-for-scientists-14053993/118520778/">post
on Nature’s Scitable site</a>.</p>
<p>The presentation should include 8 minutes for sharing your project
and 2 minutes for questions. This time allotment will be strictly
enforced. Each member of your group must present at least one slide.
Questions will be addressed to the group as a whole.</p>
