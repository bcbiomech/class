## Set up

Say we were studying the bite force of the eastern gray squirrel (*Sciurus carolinensis*).

Assume that you collected the following data, a table that contains the maximum bite force at the larger, aneteriormost incisor of the lower jaw, mass, and sex of 20 specimens.

```{r,include=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
dat <- tibble(
  mass=rnorm(20,1.4,0.5) %>% round(.,2),
  sex=rep(c("Male","Female"),10)
) %>%
  mutate(m=ifelse(sex=="Male",1,0.7)) %>% 
  mutate(Fmax=mass*2*runif(20,m-0.1,m+0.1)^0.8 %>% round(.,2))

dat %>% 
  ggplot(aes(mass,Fmax,col=sex))+geom_point()

write_csv(dat %>% select(-m),"data/bite_force.csv")
```

```{r,echo=F}
dat %>% 
  select(-m) %>% 
  kable(caption = "Table 1: Bite force data for 20 squirrels. Mass is given in kg, bite force ('Fmax') is given in N") %>% 
  kable_minimal()
```

## Objectives

1. Open, save, and establish an R markdown document that includes a YAML header with your name, title, date and output as an html [1]. 

NB: Name and save your Rmd as "Lastname_Firstname_AME0.Rmd" [-1 if not]

2. Include an R chunk that loads `tidyverse` [1].

3. Please download the data you see above by accessing [this link](data/bite_force.csv). Read it in as CSV data and save it to an object named `dat`. [3]

4. Produce an illustrative visualization of the relationship between squirrel maximum bite force and mass and how this relationship may vary by sex. [3]

## Interpretation

Please briefly comment on the evolutionary or ecological basis of any relationships your visualization reveals. [2]
