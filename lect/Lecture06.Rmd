Today we'll ....

- Wrap up with linkages

- What is stress, strain?

- Define stiffness and other material properties

- Start MP2

- Loads and deformations -- basic concepts
- Stress: the distribution of force over an area
- Strain: a dimensionless measure of deformation
- Stiffness: a measure of how materials respond to stress (or strain)
- Loads: the relationship between stress and strain
- Strength: the stress at breaking

# Material and structures

.pull-left[ 
 
- All (biological) materials respond to external forces by deforming
- We seek a way to understand and characterize these responses
- Material behavior as separate from structural behavior
- We will formalize the relationships between force and deformation

Stress: $$\sigma=\frac{F}{A}$$

$Pa=N\cdot m^2$
           
Strain $$\varepsilon=\frac{L-L_o}{L_o}$$

Units?
