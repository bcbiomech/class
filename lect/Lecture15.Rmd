Becomes even more apparent when we consider a shape the results in lots of flow changing velocities quickly (i.e., shape matters!).

Where we would always have "skin" drag, with $\mu\neq 0$, we now have "pressure" drag.

# Consequences of D'Alembert's Paradox

.pull-left[

Viscosity robs fluid of its momentum. There is a shear stress exerted on the sphere and energy is dissipated by viscosity.

Because of viscosity, velocity cannot increase as
much as in the inviscid case. 

New stagnation point where the flow separates

**Reynolds number:** Ratio of inertial forces to viscous forces within a fluid which is subjected to relative internal movement due to different fluid velocities.

How much does it seprate?

$$\small{\frac{\text{Pressure stress}}{\text{Shear stress}} \rightarrow \frac{P}{\tau} \rightarrow \frac{\rho u^2}{\mu u/L} \rightarrow Re= \frac{\rho uL}{\mu}}$$

# Re across size and velocity scales

The Re measures the relative importance of inertial vs viscous stresses in determining the flow. Conservation of Re implies identical flow patterns

What would it feel like to swim like a sperm?

How would you induce flow conditions to experience this?
