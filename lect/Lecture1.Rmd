# What sort of scripting will we use?

.pull-left[Is this a reasonable prediction? 480 N?! A typical bullet is ~500N

Let's first see how the $F_{max}$ changes with merus length (L), a standard measurement for the group.

.pull-right[
```{r,echo=FALSE,out.width=200}
knitr::include_graphics("mantis2.png")
```

Establish a function of the linear form:

$$F(m)=a+Lb$$
with coefficients from Blanco and Patek (2014) where $a=-4.4$ and $L=2.1$. So the functions takes the form

```{r}
force <-function(x){-4.4+x*2.2}  
```

# What sort of scripting will we use?

Now, establish a length range (8-40 cm) for merus length and predict force?

```{r}
L=seq(8,40,0.1)
merus.pred <- force(L)
```

Now let's plot to relationship.


```{r,dev='svg',fig.show="hold", out.width="30%",out.height="10%",fig.height=6,message=F,warning=F}
qplot(L,merus.pred)+theme_classic(30)+ylab("Force (N)")
knitr::include_graphics("merus.png")

```

Looks pretty good.

# What sort of scripting will we use?

Back to our question?

Is this way too much? Too little?

```{r,dev='svg',fig.show="hold", out.width="50%",out.height="20%",fig.height=6,warning=F}
qplot(L,merus.pred)+theme_classic(30)+ylab("Force (N)")+geom_point(aes(x=15,y=480),col="red")
knitr::include_graphics("mantis.png")

```
