# Bending 

+ In bending, load is compressive and tensile at the same time. 
+ Need a new model, not simply stress vs. strain

# Bending 


How much a beem will deform under a stress is given by the flexural stiffness (*M*): 

$$ M=EI $$
 

+ $E$ is the Young's modulus 
+ $I$ is the second moment area, which is essentially the distribution of that stiffness (i.e., area) 

For a  beam under a symmetrical bending load, the deflection is given by:

$$d=\frac{Fl^3}{3EI}$$

# Bending 

We'll be bending wood (in lab--signup link coming!!)

+ How do changes in *I* effect *M*?

# Bending 

We'll be bending wood, both wet and dry.

+ How does strain (deformation) rate effect *M*?

# Instestine: Simple tensile tests

We'll be stretching pig intestine.


+ What is the stiffness of the intestine in longitudinal and axial loading?

# Instestine: Simple tensile tests

We'll be stretching pig intestine (on your own).


+ Is this material anisostropic?
