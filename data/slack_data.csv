U06DFEQBJRF,AME1 pw is “ame1”
U06E7GRKB7W,"Is anyone else having trouble downloading the jumping data file for AME1? I get a 404 error ""file not found"" when I click the link."
U06E7GRA8P6,Yeah 
U06DFEQBJRF,Should be fixed now: 
U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi All, wanted to get this out ASAP concerning AME1: We do indeed have 4 objectives to address. I'm not sure what I was convinced of as incorrect, but, aside from a few tweaks in wording, the objectives look fined. "
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi! I was wondering, when revising our initial AME1 submission, does all of the code that is not shown in your solution need to be cut from our markdown (such as the plots we made to practice using the code)?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"I think we keep all the 'good' code as is, but put the 'wrong' code so that it's in a comment and rewrite the better version of that. So I don't think we need to touch/alter the code that works or the code not included in the AME1 solution."
U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi All, AME2 is not posted and available. The pw is ""iris"". Good luck!"
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi! In objective 3, it says to use mutate(). I just wanted to double check if that was necessary to fulfill objective 3 since I did not use that in my code but was able to compute the mean sepal and petal surface area. Thanks!"

U06E4H17N03,"For the MPs, are we submitting one report as a group and if so, how do we share our code with our group members for continual revision? Is there somewhere on slack? (only ever used Github)"

U06ETSCDGAC,"For MP1 on my mac computer, it says that the fiji software cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified, and there isn't a way to override it. Is there another way to use Fiji?"
U06E25K0NH3,Ya there is
U06DFEQBJRF,Right click open
U06DFH8NV0R,this is what we are getting for our MTrackJ analysis. we feel like there is too much variation here as compared to the example given in the MP1 instructions. could it possibly be from human error with the camera angle (i.e. not having the camera centered with our bodies)? we used all the same code from the MP1 examples to process it and the followed the black point tracking to a T. Wondering if anyone has tried to compute theirs yet and had a similar challenge
U06DFH8NV0R,circling back to this ^ can anyone else confirm whether their data looks close?

U06DFH8NV0R,"My group is getting a positive correlation between torque and flexion angle; however, we believe it should theoretically peak in value at a certain angle and not increase as it goes on. Has anyone else had this problem? If so, what did you do to solve it?"

U06DYDZ4C2J,"In class on Thursday we discussed how leg length would impact how fast someone can walk. If a person had legs that were different lengths, how would this impact the model and the process of calculating speed?"
U06DFH8NV0R,I feel like that would definitely complicate things— the uneven 
U06E7GRKB7W,I wonder if you can correct for that - maybe adding length to the shorter leg (wearing a shoe only on that foot for example) and how that would impact gait?
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class, we discussed how the walking motion was described as an inverse pendulum and that there are some scientists who dispute this idea. What are the other models that these scientists consider correct instead of the inverse pendulum model, and what are their reasons that they believe the inverse pendulum is erroneous?"
U06EHN30DDF,"how might arm swing contribute to the walking bipedal gait, and how might incorporating arm swing into the simple pendulum model influence stability?"
U06DYE17370,The inverted pendulum model of walking as described in class talks about it in relation to center of mass. How would changing your center of mass affect the model (for example leaning forwards or backwards when walking)?
U06E53GQSN6,What is the practical application of the inverted pendulum model if humans have knees and ankles that complicate the motion of walking?
U06DYE17370,"I feel like the arm swing contributes to a faster walking bipedal gait, as there tends to be more forward weight when you swing your arms contributing to a more forward center of mass. Additionally, I feel like the arm swing adds stability due to partial balance across the width of your body."
U06DYE1AMN2,In class we talked about duty factor.  But I was wondering how different types of shoes play a role in increasing/decreasing the time that the foot is in contact with the ground.  Does wearing cleats vs gym shoes vs sandals affect duty factors or are shoes simply for comfort and injury prevention?
U06E7GRKB7W,"I think the main counter-argument to modeling gait as an inverse pendulum is that the leg doesn't remain straight during walking - we bend our knees. The reading also brings in questions such as: if the pendulum model is 'correct', how can we account for the fact that we use energy during walking?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"I would think that the type of shoe does affect duty factor. If a shoe is stiffer, then I would think that it would stick less to the ground, causing the duty factor to be lower. Thus, I would think that depending how sticky or how much friction the shoe generates with the ground is how much the duty factor is affected."
U06EHN55XSM,"I think arm swing also contributes to a reduction in energy expenditure, specifically on the lower limbs as it creates momentum forward. I also did a quick google search and found a study that tested the effect of arm swing and one's walking ability. The researchers found that velocity and stride length decreased significantly while walking with one and both arms restricted."
U06EHN55XSM,"As students, we wear backpacks so frequently. I'm wondering how wearing a backpack, especially a heavy one, affects gait and the movement of the torso. Does the change in center of mass due to the backpack affect the inverted pendulum model?"
U06E7GRA8P6,In class we discussed how the inverted pendulum model depends largely on the length of the legs
U06E53G8R42,"In the textbook, Vogel describes how the current usage of ""biomechanics"" is as a branch of human, functional biology where it concerns the efficient design of mechanical prostheses to aid with locomotion. In class, we discussed the inverted pendulum model for bipedal locomotion. I am curious how the inverted pendulum model changes for an individual with a single prosthetic leg from the femoral region to the foot. Does the lack of knee and ankle flexion in one leg make the model more ideal or less reliable for calculating speed and stride length?"
U06E7GRA8P6,"I was thinking the same thing, I think that changing the center of mass also changes the length of the legs"
U06EHN30DDF,"Going off of Jaan's comment, the inverted pendulum model also neglects to account for dynamic stability, especially when walking on uneven terrains. The spring-mass model takes into account the dynamic aspects of biped walking, considering the contribution of human tissues."
U06DFH8NV0R,"Are there observable differences in walking patterns across different cultures or societies, and how can these variations be analyzed within the framework of the inverted pendulum model?"
U06DQAKCBBR,How can the inverted pendulum be an advantage or a disadvantage in the setting of rehabilitation for athletes or even just patients in general for post op surgery care? Can you use the inverted pendulum as a way to specify treatment to allow the patient to rehabilitate quicker? Can you use inverted pendulum and apply it specifically to a sport or can you not get that specific?
U06DQAKCBBR,"Yes, for instance, adjustments in terrain, like the difference between someone who regularly walks on a beach and someone who is regularly in the mountains. Utilizing the inverted pendulum model on various terrains enables the examination of how walking dynamics shift in the face of environmental obstacles. Another example is cultural customs and rituals, where traditional attire may impact walking behaviors, or even be instructed to walk a certain way in ceremonies or traditional events. This framework aids in comprehending the variations in energy expenditure and stability within rituals."
U06E5049DMH,"In class today we spoke about how looking at muscle fibers histologically are not perfectly parallel. Does this mean that stretching of our muscles which ""loosens"" them up would straighten our muscle fibers? And if so, does this have a correlation to flexibility and more flexible individuals have muscle fibers in the same direction? It would make sense as I am extremely inflexible and it feels like if I don't relax my muscles my hamstrings may just snap lol"
U06E5068859,"Thinking about how the barefoot model of running allows for less orthopedic injury long term, why have athletes in lower body dependent sports not adapted this model? Do cleats offer a form of protection that the toed shoes do not, or do the spikes on cleats not work as well on the toed shoe models?"
U06E5068859,"Ive seen a lot of people that are gymnasts, and it would seem that a lot of flexibility is trained during stretching and workouts. I think that specific muscle training can lead to greater flexibility but genetic muscle direction can also be a major factor."
U06E5049DMH,"This is definitely an interesting question. I did a little research on it and it seems as though the ""sticking in"" of the cleats to the ground allows for more grip, specifically toward the front of the foot and not the heel which we mentioned in class as barefoot runners tend to run on the balls of their feet. The cleats must add an even stronger forward force to the forefoot, making it so sprinters and lower body athletes who run on the balls of their feet have even more forward force and thus speed."
U06EHN52RG9,"In lecture we've discussed the Froude number and how it can be easier to work with because it is a dimensionless number. Are dimensionless numbers like this one really only used in describing fluids and their flow? If not, when else would they be appropriate and, in general, what are the main disadvantages of using dimensionless numbers?"
U06E25K0NH3,"In lecture today, we were discussing the differences/benefits when we run barefoot, rather than with shoes on. I thought this was very interesting, so I looked into it more, and found that running barefoot is also found to be correlated with an increased stride frequency and less time being in contact with the ground. Is this due to simply striking the ground with the balls of our feet, or is there a more complex factor at play with the spring actions that occur in our legs?"
U06E7GRQFUL,"In class today, we were talking about the differences when running barefoot and running with shoes and how when we run with shoes, we heel strike. Do we think this means that if I were to run barefoot, I wouldn't heel strike at all?"
U06E25K0NH3,"Hi Tara! I think if we run barefoot, we tend to strike with the balls of our feet much more option, but it is still possible to strike with more flat feet or even with our heels. Shoes allow us to have the support to allow for heel strikes, while running barefoot does not."
U06E4H17N03,"Hey Ava, when searching about dimensionless numbers I found that they are almost always used to characterize fluid flows/fluid dynamics. But then I found that dimensional analysis can be used in solid state physics, astrophysics, and particle physics.  Particle physics uses dimensional analysis quite often, not only to derive and verify equations, but also to understand the physics behind many quantities that are not classical. Along with fluid dynamics, dimnesional analysis is used for convection and heat transfer, but one could argue those are/are not also fluids depending on how you define it."
U06DYDZ4C2J,"In one study published in 2015, "
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi! I am also curious about this. The formulas we looked at in class didn't seem to mention center of mass, but rather just the mass value itself. We did discuss how factors such as lumbar flexion, pelvic tilt, and plantar flexion impact the speed of walking under this model. Since scoliosis can impact "
U06E7GRQFUL,"I would think that the type of shoe does affect duty factor and would also depend on how much support the shoe has which would impact the way that the shoe sticks to the ground. For example, gym shoes are known to be much more flatter than running shoes for example, which are known to have a lot more cushion and are sometimes plated with nylon or carbon plates."
U06DYE1AMN2,"I would assume that the center of mass with a back pack may not change when we stand up, but it likely changes based on posture"
U06E53G8R42,"As far as I understand stretching, I think you are right in may ways Colin. Since the length of a muscle cell is equivalent to the length of the muscle itself, by pulling on each end of the muscle and creating tension, at least some of the sarcomeres down the length of the muscle cell must be pulled to a greater degree of separation between actin and myosin filaments. The degree to which every sarcomere extends would be dependent on the conditioning of that muscle and how frequently it is stretched. Any tensile force that is not used to elongate the sarcomere would be applied to the connective tissues of the muscle which would result in them straightening as well and aligning in the muscle's direction of pull. This is why stretching is so important to posture as muscles act on joints as agonists and antagonists. So if one muscle is overly tight, it will dictate the position of how the skeleton is positioned around a joint."
U06EHN52RG9,"I looked more into the kinematics of barefoot running, and some sources say that many of the advantages of the former come from the decrease in force magnitudes on the lower extremity and joints. The real reduction in force magnitude was observed when subjects had a forefoot striking pattern, so more on the balls of our feet like you mentioned. Heel-striking or a rearfoot striking pattern was found to lead to injury, even during barefoot running, as it increased the load on the lower leg."
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class on Thursday, we talked about the stress vs. strain curve and how animals over 20 kg are able to run/gallop because of their larger efficient mechanical advantage. I was wondering how this model would apply to an animal like a kangaroo that weighs over 20 kg and can hop fairly fast? Would a kangaroo have a small effective mechanical advantage?"
U06DQAKCBBR,"From the reading I was interested more about joints as we learned about all sorts of joints in anatomy. I was wondering if people could expand on or give their input about how the range of motions and degrees of freedom in ordinary joints, that are characterized by rotational and translational movements, compare between human-made joints and those found in the natural world, when taking into consideration the adaptability and efficiency of these joint structures in different biological systems?"
U06DQAKCBBR,"I think that the mechanical advantage of a kangaroo in a stress vs. strain curve would depend on various factors, including the specific muscle and skeletal structure involved in its jumping mechanism. This is because generally, kangaroos are adapted for efficient hopping, utilizing the stretch and release of tendons as a form of energy storage during locomotion. This adaptation might contribute to a relatively high mechanical advantage, enhancing their jumping efficiency by optimizing the transfer of force. Since there is so many factors it seems hard to say if a kangaroo would have a large or small effective mechanical advantage or not as I feel like every kangaroo is different I don't know if anyone can add to that."
U06DYE1AMN2,In class today we talked lever systems and how as humans we have many of each type of lever system throughout our body.  I am wondering how natural selection has played apart in these lever systems.  It had to be advantageous and disadvantageous to have lever systems in certain spots (for example having a third lever system in our arms and legs compared to 1st or 2nd)  Why do you think its the case that this is how the human body developed?  Could it be due to energy conservation/efficiency?
U06EHN30DDF,"Last Tuesday, we discussed the spring-mass model for running and how stored potential energy in elastic tissue such as the calcaneal tendon is transferred to kinetic energy for propulsion. How might spring-mass model dynamics differ between sprinting and endurance running?"
U06E5068859,"During today’s class we discussed how levers are used in our body. Since the force of a 1st lever system is applied across the fulcrum it would apply strain to the fulcum itself, is this why there are not many 1st lever systems in the body or is there a different reason?"
U06E5068859,"I think this is interesting and some of what we talked about with the jaw can be applied. Using a 2nd or third system would be more helpful in areas of the body that require more or less force than others, so it would make sense that these levers would develop accordingly."
U06EHN55XSM,"Thinking about people who are double-jointed, how might this impact the biomechanics in the human body? Does this increase in range of motion influence  mechanical advantage and physical movement? Are there advantages to this increased movement or is it more dangerous that the joints are moving beyond their 'normal' range of motion?"
U06EHN55XSM,"Thinking about natural vs. human-made joints, my thought is that the human-made joints may lack the biological responsiveness and ability to self-regulate like natural joints. Human-made joints are also made out of materials like metals and ceramics, and while they are engineered to mimic the properties of natural joints, they are not able to fully replicate the complexity of biological tissues and adaptability of natural joints."
U06E7GRKB7W,"I think there may be more to it than simply strain. The development of bodies (and so our 'levers') might have more to do with the tradeoffs between force and speed (as we saw in class). Also our muscles tend to be arranged in ways that don't result in first class lever systems. I don't know if that answers your question, but I don't think it's in order to avoid strain that we specifically don't have very many first class lever systems in our bodies."
U06E7GRKB7W,We talked about how arthropods have different 'joints' than vertebrates - is it possible for invertebrates to have other joints than hinge joints? Could they evolve more elastic areas of the exoskeleton to have more diversity in types of movements?
U06E25K0NH3,"I'm still a little confused about the first, second, and third class levers. I know we talked about how the jaw differed based on where the food was being chewed (peanut in the back vs apple in the front), but does the class of lever also change based on where the food is being chewed?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"I was a little confused at first too but I think I got it now.

Think of it like this: When you’re eating something with your front teeth, like biting an apple, your jaw acts like a third-class lever. Your muscles put in work close to the pivot point and the bite force is further out. It’s great for quick bites but not the strongest grip.

Now, when you’re cracking a peanut with your molars, it’s more like a second-class lever. The fulcrum is still your jaw joint, but the peanut is between the force and the fulcrum. It’s like using a nutcracker; you get more force on that peanut to crush it.

So, where the food is in your mouth can change how the lever system of your jaw works. The actual food "
U06DYE17370,"It seems that if you over use joints that are double jointed it will create more strain on the tendons and also create less tension. Therefore I would think that there is not a huge advantage to being double-jointed, if anything if overused it could cause injury down the line due to this strain and possible dislocations."
U06DYE17370,"In class we talked about joints and how they can be equated to levers. I was wondering what certain conditions like arthritis can do to the joint lever systems (mechanistically, not pain wise)."
U06E5049DMH,When we think about joints in the body at least for a human we know theat we are bound by ligaments and can only rotate about certain axis and such. The obviously must not apply to animals such as snakes which can contort their body in any which way right? Does this mean they are chuck full of joints that allow virtually full range of motion or are they muscle and cartilage only?
U06E5049DMH,"Good question! It seems that arthritis is actually considered an autoimmune disease. With that being said, your body breaks down the membranes of your synovial joints, not only causing pain but mechanistically making you stiffer at each joint. This breakdown can create scar tissue (leading to more stiffness) as well as full breakdown of cartilage and breakdown of bones from heavy friction. Over time, there may not even be a joint left!"
U06E53GQSN6,"How do variations in joint structure and lever configurations impact the mechanical advantage of specific muscle groups during common movements like walking or lifting, and how can this knowledge inform personalized exercise programs or ergonomic interventions for different individuals?"
U06E7GRA8P6,"Today we learned about the various lever systems in the body. How does the arrangement of muscles, bones, and joints in the human body contribute to the effectiveness of lever systems? Are there ways to actively change these factors to improve effectiveness?"
U06E7GRQFUL,"In class today, we talked about lever systems and the different types of lever systems we have throughout our body. Do most humans have the same type of levers in the same area of our bodies or can it vary, as is it better or advantageous to have one type of lever over another?"
U06EHN52RG9,"Last week we discussed scaling in locomotion, specifically in regard to terrestrial animals. What does the relationship between increasing/decreasing mass and the capacity of a bone to generate force look like in aquatic mammals?"
U06E53G8R42,"The past two lectures we have learned about scaling and effective mechanical advantage related to lever arms and force inputs and outputs across species. I'm curious how much of an effect these principles have within members of the same species. For example in powerlifting and strength events, smaller competitors by size frequently have higher relative strength output to their body mass than physically larger competitors. Is effective mechanical advantage and the proportion of the length of the In-lever to the out-lever the biggest factor in this phenomenon?"
U06EMNFUDFW,"Highlighting the sliding filament theory, based on the molecular and structural details that underly this theory, how do different variations of these mechanisms contribute to or affect our understanding of muscle function, adaptation, and possible therapeutic or medical interventions?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"I feel like the relationship would be fairly different compared to that of terrestrial mammals. Aquatic mammals have other factors like the density of water and its buoyancy that  affect their locomotion. For example, the blue whale is the largest mammal on earth, and it would drastically exceed the 20 kg rule that we discussed in class. Additionally, a swimming motion might be very different compared to a running motion."
U06E4H17N03,Hey Mark! I found a pretty interesting papers discussing multiple factors that contribute to shorter people having more relative strength than taller people. 
U06E4H17N03,heres the link! 
U06EMNFUDFW,"Well, I would think that in general, most humans would have the same type of levers in the same area of the body for basic functions because of the way the type of lever depends on the specific task of movement. For example, first-class levers are used for nodding the head forward and backward, a second class lever is used when we stand on our tiptoes, and a third-class lever is used when we curl our bicep or flex our forearm at the elbow. On the other hand, I do think that how these levers are distributed throughout the body can vary depending on the habits of the individual in question. For example, someone who is frequently lifting heavy things or weight training, they be using second-class levers at an increased rate because of the mechanical advantage they provide."
U06EMNFUDFW,"So, in short, I think the distribution of lever types throughout the human body can vary."
U06EHN30DDF,"It seems the effectiveness of lever systems would be affected by muscle origins and insertions, joint structure, and muscle contractions, as these would all affect the type of lever system employed. Thus, strength and flexibility training for muscles and joints as well as focusing on proper technique during exercise could improve effectiveness and minimize injury."
U06DYE1AMN2,This is a really good question and when you think about the arm it has multiple lever systems in it.  The forearm and triceps create a different lever system than the biceps and forearm.  It is important that the lever systems differ allowing us for easier (less energy required) movements.  For example flexing the arm needs that 3rd class lever system while extending the arm needs a 1st class lever.
U06E7GRQFUL,"I believe that if you are double jointed, there is a possibility that you could have a mechanical advantage depending on what exercise or sport the person partakes in, as double jointedness comes with an increased range of motion. However, this hyper mobility in the joints affects our locomotor system biomechanically due to a lack of tension and ligament failure, which can lead to limited strength and increased fatigue and weakness in the muscles, which could make a person more prone to dislocations and other athletic injuries."
U06E7GRA8P6,This is an interesting question. I think it's important to consider that each person has a unique arrangement of muscles that in turn result in unique lever behaviors.
U06E53G8R42,"Hi Colin! Although snakes are very flexible and use a different method of serpentine locomotion compared to terrestrial organisms we commonly think of, snakes are still vertebrates with individual bones that must be organized and held together with other connective tissues such as ligaments. The slithering of snakes is not due to virtually unrestricted movement at any one joint but instead due to the compilation of a series of joints that are each permitted to move within a certain range of motion."
U06EHN52RG9,"When sprinting, runners apply greater forces compared to their body mass during shorter periods of contact time with the ground. In regard to spring-mass dynamics applying to sprinters, peak force is exerted when center of mass is at its lowest point. Endurance runners run at decreased speeds comparatively, so the maximal centers of mass are higher than in sprinters. Leg stiffness also increases with speed, so sprinters have stiffer lower limbs compared to endurance runners."
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Looking at Lecture 6, how is stiffness usually determined, and how would you graph it?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"The book refers to stiffness as the slope of the stress/strain graph. In class, we saw that this curve isn't necessarily linear (non-Hookean materials) - what part of the curve is used to determine a value for stiffness? Is this based on simple convention or is there a physical reason behind it?"
U06EHN30DDF,how does muscle fiber type (slow-twitch and fast-twitch) contribute to the force production of a muscle?
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class today, we talked a lot about stress vs strain, and we talked about the safety factor. I was wondering how the safety factor of land animals would compare to that of aquatic animals? My initial thought was that aquatic animals would experience a lower maximum stress because of their aquatic environment, and, thus, they would have a lower safety factor."
U06E5068859,"I have some trouble understanding the directionality of the muscle work curve and how it can change, can someone explain that in more detail?"
U06E5068859,"I think that is a fair argument since a lot of the species we see in ocean environments are much larger than other species, but due to the factor that they do not need any ground force potential, it is probable that there is much less consideration going into that safety factor as considered to land animals"
U06E5049DMH,"Today in class we talked on stress and strain, and it got me thinking about objects such as bulletproof glass. We saw how glass has a strong stiffness value, but what makes bulletproof glass different? Are the materials made in the glass structured differently to make it stiffer or do they add different material? If they add different material or change the structure how can we still see through it?"
U06DYE17370,"I also found this question interesting, and after looking it up found that bulletproof glass has multiple layers. The layers alternate between regular glass with a strong stiffness value, and a softer material like plastic so we can still see through it. The plastic works to help absorb the energy so that the glass doesn't shatter."
U06DYE17370,"In class today it was mentioned how presumably the large dinosaurs had a very low safety factor and therefore were not able to jump or run. What would happen if the safety factor became less than one, that is the working stress is greater than the ultimate stress? Would the animal not be able to stand?"
U06DYE1AMN2,Today in class we talked about collagen differing in direction which makes it so the stress/strain graph is not straight
U06DFH8NV0R,"How can the non-linear stress-strain relationships of biological tissues, especially the toe region and yield point, guide the development of more compatible and functional biomedical implants and prosthetics?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"If the safety factor drops below one, meaning the working stress exceeds the ultimate stress, the material (or in this case, the dinosaur's bones) would likely fail under its own weight, making it difficult or impossible for the animal to stand or move without risking injury or structural failure. Essentially, the bones would not be able to support the animal's weight, leading to potential collapses or fractures."
U06EHN55XSM,"The yield point and stress-strain relationships could help researchers understand the tissue's ability to withstand and recover from deformation and with these considerations in mind, scientists could create more durable prosthetics, ensuring a longer lifespan and reducing the need for frequent replacements."
U06EHN55XSM,"After an organism has broken a bone, broke through skin, torn a ligament, ect, and has fully healed, does their maximum stress of that material decrease? Are their bones/materials able to fully recover and reach the same maximum stress level or because of the damage in that area, has their maximum stress level forever decreased? Is this why some people break the same bone multiple times?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"I think it depends if the tissue has been fully 'healed' or not. If not, there would be differences in material properties: scar tissue could have a different composition (or have fibers in a different arrangement) than health tissue, and that would affect maximum stress level negatively. This is definitely related to repeated the same bone multiple times, especially if the person continues to expose themselves to the same physical trauma."
U06E7GRQFUL,"Based on our discussion of dinosaurs and other large organisms and their ability to walk, run or jump; how would an organism's movement be impacted if it has an increased (or decreased) bone density, and has more or less calcium in their bone?"
U06E53GQSN6,"Mammals that hop around, like kangaroos--are their bones less brittle and more elastic and/or is the structure/arrangement of the bones complementary to this mode of locomotion?"
U06E7GRA8P6,What factors contribute to the long-term integrity and maximum stress tolerance of bone and other biological tissues following injury and healing processes?
U06E25K0NH3,"We talked today about the strength of bones relating to large dinosaurs, and how it is difficult to understand whether or not they were capable of running. When applied to other large dinosaurs that were bipedal, like a t-rex, how do there bone structure/ densities differ, and can we definitely say they were capable of running at high speeds, like many movies/tv shows depict?"
U06EHN52RG9,"In class, we discussed the stress-strain curve, biological materials, and what it actually means when something breaks. Considering biological materials, like tendons, hair, bone, etc., how do the material properties change after the the breaking (yield) point? How often does this technical definition of breaking actually entail fracture?"
U06DQAKCBBR,"We didn't seem to get to this in class, but how does the cardiovascular system in vertebrates exhibit resilience against external stressors, considering factors such as the elasticity of blood vessels, the buffering capacity of the circulatory system, and hormonal regulation and cardiovascular responses, from the context of physiological adaptations in vertebrates?"
U06DQAKCBBR,"Numerous factors affect the maximum stress tolerance and long-term integrity of biological tissues, including bone, after injury and healing processes. The ability of bone tissue to reconstruct itself, fueled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, is essential for maintaining structural integrity and gradually adjusting to mechanical stresses. Bone tissue's resilience is influenced by the mineralization and collagen quality found in the extracellular matrix, which affects the tissue's capacity to tolerate stress and deformation. Biological elements that affect tissue remodeling and repair include growth factors, cytokines, and signaling molecules. These elements control cellular activities that impact the healing response as a whole. Also, elements including hormonal balance, mechanical loading patterns, and dietary status also affect the long-term integrity and stress tolerance of biological tissues post-injury."
U06E53G8R42,"Today in lecture we discussed how the bones of large bird-hip dinosaurs can be used to predict patterns or limitations in their locomotion. Because these large animals most likely did not run or become airborne in anyway, the multidirectional forces on the ball and socket joints of these dinosaurs would be lessened. Is the ratio of compact to cancellous bone at the epiphysis of long bones significantly skewed towards compact bone unlike in other vertebrates because of its higher stiffness?"
U06GBE40483,"Today we talked about designing a comparative study to assess the movement of a large dinosaur. Beyond selecting animals of similar body types/weight, are there certain movement type/mechanical classifications for animals? Or do all animals of similar weight/body type converge on a similar method of walking and running?"
U06E4H17N03,"Can someone explain safety factor a little more in depth, specifically does it change based on the action that you are requiring of that material? Slide 17 gave examples of the safety factor of different bones within an animal, so does that mean it was referring to the same ""stress situation"" being induced to the organism as a whole and demonstrating how that afffects each bone differently?"
U06E4H17N03,"From class, I have that
"
U06E25K0NH3,"I was also curious about this question, so I did some more research into it. I found that it seems to be a combination of both increased elasticity, and a different structure of bones. Kangaroos had a longer and stronger hind limbs, and a strong tail that assists in the impact, and strength, needed to hop around. They also have specialized ankle joints that act in a similar manner to springs."
U06EHN52RG9,The maximal load a bone can support before fracture occurs is positively related to bone mineral density. Lack of subjecting bones to mechanical and gravitational forces will cause increased calcium excretion and bone mineral loss in weight-bearing bones. Decreased bone density and calcium makes fracture more likely to occur.
U06E5049DMH,That’s
U06ETSCDGAC,"I feel like it would all come down to how the larger bipedal dinosaurs differ from the quadrupeds in their effective mechanical advantage and additionally their bone density like you mentioned. A higher bone density would enable the bipedal organisms to withstand the ground force that comes from running, so we expect them to have a greater bone density than quadrupeds. Additionally, I bet there is some movie exaggerations of how fast they are actually able to run."
U06EHN30DDF,"Changes in material properties of tissues such as tendon and bone can lead to decreased stiffness and a higher susceptibility to further deformation, given the structural changes, such as the addition of scar tissue, that occurs after the yield point is reached. Acute stress results in complete failure of the tissue, which occurs in a fracture."
U06E53GQSN6,"When designing a comparative study to assess the movement of large dinosaurs or any animals, it's crucial to consider various movement types and mechanical classifications. While animals of similar body types may exhibit some similarities in locomotion, factors such as quadrupedalism vs. bipedalism, different gaits, mechanical efficiency, terrestrial vs. arboreal vs. aquatic locomotion, pacing vs. trotting vs. galloping, static vs. dynamic stability, and specialized adaptations can result in significant differences in how animals move. Therefore, beyond selecting animals of similar body types and weights, researchers must account for these factors to accurately compare and analyze the movement of different species."
U06E7GRQFUL,"While both muscle fiber types contribute to the force production of the muscle, it is whether it is fast twitch or slow twitch which will provide the variation of the intensity of force it produces. Slow-twitch fibers provide sustained force over time and are enhanced during endurance sports such as running long distances, while fast-twitch fibers contributes to quick and powerful contractions used in explosive movements and activities such as resistance and strength training."
U06E7GRA8P6,"Today we talked about toughness in relation to muscles and how much energy is required to fracture a material. The power produced by joints and muscles is determined by net joint torque. The overall more e every consumed, the more “tough.” "
U06DYE1AMN2,"
I feel like the vertebrate cardiovascular system's resilience against external stressors is facilitated by elastic blood vessels, buffering mechanisms, and hormonal regulation"
U06DYDZ4C2J,Hi Jack! This is one stress/strain curve I found from a 
U06E53G8R42,"In addition to a decrease in general bone density causing an increased risk of bone fracture, a lack of collagen in bone will make the bone less flexible and more brittle. So while it is important to have high bone density and inorganic calcium components in healthy bone, organic materials are equally important for supporting movements such as jumping, running, and complex gaits. "
U06DQAKCBBR,"After doing the reading for Tuesday I am curious of how the concept of torsional flexibility in natural structures may challenge conventional engineering principles, and what are people's thoughts on the implications which it may hold for future design innovations in various fields?"
U06EHN30DDF,"In response to our discussion of fracture theory from class last Thursday, how does the microstructure and organization of bone influence fracture behavior? How does age and gender affect bone fracture risk and healing?"
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Thinking about our lecture from last Thursday on toughness, are there any materials that have 100% resilience?"
U06DYE17370,"In looking it up, I couldn't find a material with 100% resilience. I found different answers on what is the most resilient substance, varying from a copper spring to resilin (the wing hinge we talked about in class)."
U06DYE17370,I'm a little confused on viscoelastics from our discussion last Thursday. Specifically the difference for the equations of solids versus liquids and why you don't use viscocity in the spring equations.
U06DFH8NV0R,How do the contrasting skeletal adaptations for speed in predators like the cheetah and for agility in prey like the gazelle illustrate the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey species?
U06DQAKCBBR,"In response to the first part of your question, I think something to consider is the mechanical characteristics of bones. Simply thinking about like compact bone is made even stronger by the osteons that diffuse energy and deflect fissures, preventing fractures from spreading. The microarchitecture of trabecular or cancellous bone has the flexibility, and this configuration increases the bone's resistance to compressive stresses and promotes efficient stress distribution, which lowers the chance of fractures. With the dynamic parts of the bone over time, bones can adjust their microstructure to better tolerate stresses and fend off fractures. So flexibility, strength, stress distribution, and dynamic adaptation, the microstructure and organization of bone affect fracture behavior which inhibits the spread of cracks and increases the bone's resistance to mechanical forces, which lowers the risk of fractures."
U06E53GQSN6,"Discussion Question:

Drawing from the analysis of safety factors during locomotion and running activities in various species presented in Lecture 9 on Coarse Structures, coupled with the understanding that taller individuals may be at risk for increased injury, how do the observed differences in mean bending safety factors among species correlate with their respective structural adaptations and biomechanical demands? Furthermore, considering the significance of shape in determining structural integrity, how might the variations in local and Euler buckling thresholds among different species provide insights into the biomechanics underlying the occurrence and location patterns of skeletal injuries, particularly focusing on hip fractures in humans and other mammals, and how might these insights inform our understanding of injury risks associated with height variation within populations?"
U06E5049DMH,"Im a bit confused still on the example Professor Kenaley gave in class with the horizontal vs vertical paper. One of us in class said that you would be standing on more matter if standing on the vertical structure, but Kenaley said that it is the same for both which I do not fully understand. Could someone explain this to me?"
U06DYE1AMN2,"When discussing bending in class rib came to mind for me.  Obviously ribs are shaped more curved to protect the heart and other internal organs.  How does the curvature and cross-sectional shape of ribs contribute to their flexural stiffness and resistance to bending forces, and how does this structural adaptation balance the need for both support and flexibility in protecting the thoracic cavity?"
U06E5049DMH,"Good question! I became a little confused when we introduced that part of a car that has both solid and fluid components, but one thing I do remember is that the solid portion of this object is the spring, which means we would not use viscocity in the spring equation and only the spring displacement and spring constant to find force. Viscosity however must be taken into consideration for liquids and how a solid moves through them. For liquids, the velocity of an object moving through them changes the resistance of the liquid to movement through it which means there is a need for viscocity to be included."
U06DFH8NV0R,"I believe that Prof. Kenaley's point was that the difference in bending resistance between the horizontal and vertical orientations of the paper comes from the distribution of material relative to the bending axis (second moment of area), not from standing on ""more"" or ""less"" matter. The quantity of material remains constant; it's the geometry and orientation that change the structural behavior."
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class today, we talked about how gibbons are more likely to experience a break in their femur because of their evolutionary need to be mobile in the trees. Do they have another adaptation that helps lessen this chance or that enables them to heal faster if their femur does break? My thinking was that they would want to be less prone to femur breaks because they would have a higher chance of falling out of trees and experiencing a greater force on their bones."
U06E7GRKB7W,"How might flexural stiffness and thus sturdiness for long bones change as animal size increases, given similar lifestyles? Does a very large animal have a 'better' flexural stiffness given an increase in cross-sectional area? Or does length of the bone matter more in terms of sturdiness?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"I had a similar thought in that yes, the ribs protect internal organs but they also need to be able to accommodate movement of the lungs (like expansion). I looked up cross-sections of ribs and found that ribs are composed of spongy bone on the interior and compact bone on the exterior, meaning that ribs are composite structures that can be both resilient and rigid. I'm sure there are other factors such as the cartilage parts and the very shape that assist in distributing force effectively, but the composition of the bone itself is what first came to mind."
U06E5068859,"Since Gibbons move through trees primarily with their arms, I think having their legs break on a large impact is not a complete death sentence, so this is a good example of evolution not being ideal, but just moving down a path that encourages survival. The benefit of having legs be mobile but easy to break outweighs the impact of a broken leg on chances of survival."
U06E7GRQFUL,"Circling back to our discussion on toughness, is there one material that is the 'most' resilient?"
U06E7GRA8P6,"In class we learned how gibbons' arboreal adaptations, their musculoskeletal characteristics, agility, and potential bone remodeling capabilities serve as evolutionary strategies to mitigate the risk of breakage and facilitate efficient healing in the event of femur injuries.  These changes ultimately factor into bone agility and contribute to survival in specific habitats."
U06E25K0NH3,"Today during class, we were talking about the comparisons in safety factors in different organisms during different locomotions. There is a slide that says that a man weightlifting has a high safety factor, but would it be higher or lower when a human is sprinting? My guess would be that it would be higher, but it could also depend on how much weight being lifted."
U06EHN55XSM,"I don't necessarily believe that there is one material that is the 'most' resilient. I think it heavily depends on the specific situation/criteria for one material to be labeled as the 'most' resilient material. Different materials excel in various aspects and the choice of material often depends on the intended application and environmental conditions. I think evolution and engineers have created materials that are 'most' resilient for some in specific conditions, but wouldn't be the 'most' resilient for others in a different environment."
U06E53G8R42,in class we talked about how the compression safety factor for a human weightlifting is a value of 6 which indicates that the force exerted on the bone is one sixth of the force at breaking point. How would this safety factor change with various weightlifting exercises such as open vs closed kinetic chain movements or when using the bodyweight as the weight in weight training as in the case of a pull up or inverted row?
U06EHN55XSM,Is there such thing as too high of a safety factor that it would actually be harmful to the organism?
U06E4H17N03,"I beleive it would be lower when sprinting becuase as mentioned in class today, all of of the low safety factors in the chart describe locomotion where you leave the ground. So sprinting would have a lower safety factor due to  greater ground reaction force. But you're also right in that it could depend on the amount of weight lifted as well as the excercise being performed. Say you were doing trap bar jumps or any type of weighted explosive movement where you leave the ground, your safety factor may be lower than a light jog or sprint."
U06E4H17N03,"Is what we talked about today on zoom with ""I"" essentially a more technical way of talking about weight distribution? or are  these separate, unrelated qualities?"
U06EHN52RG9,How does being bipedal versus quadrupedal affect the safety factor? What evolutionary adaptations may have developed as a result of this difference in locomotion?
U06ETSCDGAC,I would think that at some point it would become detrimental if the organism was losing other traits in order to make this safety factor higher. There is probably a point in which it becomes too burdensome and requires too much nutrients for the organism.
U06EHN30DDF,"Natural selection and co-evolution drive the evolutionary arms race between predator and prey. In terms of skeletal adaptations, the cheetah has long, slender limbs and a flexible spine for efficiency and rapid acceleration. The gazelle has shorter, sturdier limbs for agility in evading capture. "
U06E25K0NH3,"I believe some adaptation thats bipedal organisms have developed over time in order to maintain a safety factor would be routed in a modified skeletal structure. Bipeds have a wider pelvis, and a more curved spine in order to mitigate stress. Quadrupeds, I would think, have an upper hand, as they have four limbs that can distribute the weight, resulting in a higher safety factor. I think some evolutionary traits that have developed in quadrupeds would have to do with species entering new environments millions of years ago. I'm sure the first arboreal species had to have higher flexural stiffness."
U06E53GQSN6,"The compression safety factor in weightlifting, typically set at a value of 6, reflects the force exerted on bones relative to their breaking point. This factor can vary depending on the type of exercise performed, such as open or closed kinetic chain movements, and whether body weight or external resistance is used. Closed kinetic chain exercises often distribute loads more evenly, potentially leading to a higher safety factor, while open chain exercises may exert more direct pressure on specific bones or joints, potentially lowering the safety factor. Bodyweight exercises, like pull-ups or inverted rows, involve lifting a load equivalent to one's body weight, with safety factors influenced by individual weight distribution, technique, and bone strength. Ultimately, maintaining proper form, gradual progression, and considering individual factors like bone density are essential for ensuring a safe training environment across different weightlifting exercises."
U06DYE1AMN2,The safety factor curing weightlifting should be higher compared to sprinting. This is because of the way the body moves during each exercise
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi Elisabeth, I believe ""I"" (second moment of area) has more to do with how stress is distributed based on the shape of a structure whereas weight distribution is concerned with how mass of distributed. Considering that, it does seem they these values are related since they both consider distribution across a structure; however, I don't believe these terms are synonymous since ""I"" focuses especially on shape and stress which weight distribution doesn't seem to account for."
U06E7GRA8P6,"What safety considerations arise from the transition between bipedalism and quadrupedalism, and how do these differing modes of locomotion drive evolutionary adaptations?"
U06GBE40483,"From what I read online, it seems that sturdiness depends on how well the increase in cross sectional area can “compensate for increased length of the bones.” While larger animals do have bones with greater cross sectional area, the ratio of cross sectional area and length may not be optimized resulting in comparatively “worse” flexural stiffness."
U06DQAKCBBR,"Regarding slide 6 from yesterday class, I was late to lecture, so my question is how does the strain rate at various temperatures and moisture levels influence the wood's modulus of elasticity and ultimate strength?"
U06E7GRKB7W,I might be misunderstanding but if 
U06EHN30DDF,"relating to lecture from last Thursday, do the microstructural properties of bone influence its bending and resistance to fracture? how might this apply to osteoporosis and other bone disorders?"
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Considering our lecture from today, what is the largest biological example of a suction?"
U06DYE17370,Today in class we talked about how suctions underwater are stronger than suctions in air because water is not compressible. I was wondering if minerals or ions present in water (such as salt water) affect this compressibility and therefore suction capability?
U06E25K0NH3,"In class today, we spoke of van der Waal's forces and how it relates to suction utilized my many organisms. I was wondering, if these interactions assist some organisms to walk across walls and ceilings, are there some surfaces that work better to create partial charges? Would some fluids present on the surface of the wall allow for better adhesion/suction?"
U06DYE17370,"In looking it up, I found conflicting answers. In terms of feeding, which doesn't related as much to what we discussed in class, large mammals like whales and elephants use suction to intake their food. In terms of the suction cups, it would most likely be large octopi as the largest organism to display this usage."
U06E5049DMH,"Today in class we talked about different types of adhesions for different biological animals. When looking at suction vs capillary adhesion, there are some differences but the structures seem similar. Is this due to an evolutionary change when some animals left the water and became amphibians like frogs which we know use capillary adhesion. Is capillary adhesion younger than suction then?"
U06E5049DMH,Great 
U06DFH8NV0R,"How can the variability in adhesion strength of spider silk, which allows spiders to control the stickiness of different sections of their web for capturing prey and providing locomotion, inspire the design of smart adhesive materials with tunable adhesion properties?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class today we talked about how the remora essentially have a cantilever that aids them in suctioning to their target organism. Is it the cantilever attaching to the scales of another organism or the suctioning around it that creates the feeling associated with the remora being attached to its target organism? Also, which one enables more attachment to the target organism?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"Based on what I could find online, my guess would be that suctioning is younger than capillary adhesion due to the idea that mollusks, of which octopus and squid belong, evolved before amphibians evolved. Thus, suctioning might have been used before amphibians on land evolved to utilize capillary adhesion."
U06E7GRKB7W,I saw that remoras have lamellae in their sucker and that they could adjust the area being sealed. Anyone know if this also could help with grip? (Wasn't here today)
U06E53GQSN6,I recall learning about a butterfly that had adhesive wings which allowed it to perch on leaves.  Would this kind of adhesion be useful in the context of biomimicry?
U06DFH8NV0R,"Yes, the adhesive properties of butterfly wings could be highly useful in biomimicry, offering inspiration for developing innovative materials with lightweight adhesion suitable for delicate applications, such as sensitive sensors, environmental monitoring devices, or non-damaging adhesives for use on fragile surfaces."
U06EHN52RG9,"When we were talking about remoras in class today, it was mentioned how different remora species typically attach to different hosts, like sharks, whales, rays, turtles, etc. What morphological differences could cause this species-specific proclivity for certain hosts (i.e. spinule stiffness, number of lamellae, strength/size of erector/depressor muscles attached to lamellae)?"

U06E5068859,"During class we talked about how octopus move with suction cups, but are there any other sea animals that move like that other than squids? Or are cupped legs specifically for that type of sea creature?"
U06E7GRA8P6,"Today we talked about mollusks and their ability to adhere to surfaces through a thin film of fluid and the tension it creates when it interacts with a surface. I was wondering, do barnacles act the same way? Or is that a different mechanism?"
U06DYE1AMN2,We talked about glue being a molecular adhesive in class.  But I was wondering about quick sand.  Is quick sand considered to be a molecular adhesive? I know that quicksand has adhesive properties but it is made of mostly water (which is not adhesive).
U06E7GRQFUL,What is the most popular example (or most-used) of suction?
U06EHN55XSM,Do the size and shape of a suction cup impact it's ability to maintain a vacuum seal on different structures?
U06EHN55XSM,"Doing a quick google search it looks like cuttlefish, who are closely related to octopuses and squid, have specialized tentacles with suction cups although their structure varies slightly."
U06GBE40483,Does the water’s salinity affect the dynamics of creating  suction under water?
U06E53G8R42,"After doing some research, I learned that the colossal squid has not only suckers, but also claws that are used to latch onto prey items as well as for movement. Under what circumstances would each (suckers or claws) be favorable when catching a prey item? "
U06E4H17N03,Can someone explain how a cantilever works more plainly and give some real world examples?
U06E4H17N03,I found an 
U06DQAKCBBR,"This is a question that interests me personally as well. In my opinion, quicksand is a combination of fine sand, clay, and water that behaves more like a sticky liquid despite frequently seeming solid. Stepping into quicksand throws off the equilibrium between the water's solid particles and makes it act like a liquid, engulfing you. Quicksand is not the same as glue, even though it may catch and grip onto objects, which is one of its adhesive qualities. Instead of adhering to items through molecules like glue, quicksand's adhesive qualities are derived from its viscosity, which allows it to trap and hold onto objects. So I do not believe that chemical bonds are the reason quicksand is sticking to you."
U06E5068859,"A cantilever is simply a structure that is supported on only one side, like a bridge missing one side of its legs, but it is able to stand due to the way the one sides leg is constructed making it resist the sheer forces that would cause the structure to collapse. The increased difficulty in engineering and design makes it so this is not very common in buildings but the example on last weeks slide is perfect for a building."
U06DYE1AMN2,"I'm not 100% sure but I think that the higher salinity increases water density which would then change the efficiency of creating suction. Additionally, salinity influences the viscosity of water, altering the flow dynamics around objects attempting to create suction, potentially affecting suction force."
U06GBE40483,"I read online that the suckers are primarily used to hold their prey in place once it has been caught. However, the claws are more for slashing and capturing their prey."
U06E25K0NH3,"I would think that the most popular/well-known example of suction would be with octopuses and squids.  It was interesting to learn that their suctions are very strong in class, stronger than most suctions out of the water. I did some research on what it the most used form of suction for humans, and I found that suction in medical fields was the most common."
U06EHN30DDF,"According to the Marine Education Society of Australasia, barnacles attach to hard surfaces via a ""cement"" produced by the first pair of antennae in a process known as ""biofouling."" The adhesive is primarily composed of proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. "
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi Tess, this article was especially helpful in considering the mechanical properties of bones in relation to osteoporosis: "
U06E7GRQFUL,"I'm pretty sure that the water's salinity can affect various dynamics of creating suction after water, which can include variables such as viscosity and density. As salinity increases, density will increase an object's tendency to float and the forces involved in creating function; likewise with viscosity, salinity can impact viscosity which can affect the ease in which water flows."
U06E7GRA8P6,"I believe it’s a combination of both? They have a flattened, front-facing dorsal fin that has a strong suctioning ability, which allows remoras to attach themselves. I personally think that the suction created matters more to attachment"
U06EHN52RG9,"Hi Michael, I found this paper that looks at geckos ability to walk across a fluorinated substrate under wet and dry conditions. Fluorinated substrates create non-stick surfaces. The researchers observed that geckos slip on fluorinated substrates when dry, but not when the surface was wet. Contrary to what they hypothesized, the researchers found that roughness had minimal effect on shear adhesion on dry and wet fluorinated substrates. In regard to the fluorination, however, they found that fluorination was critical to shear adhesion on dry fluorinated surfaces more than on wet fluorinated surfaces. They further concluded that van der Waal's forces where more effective on wet fluorinated substrates than dry."
U06EHN30DDF,can someone explain again how frogs use molecular adhesion and specialized toe pads to stick to surfaces?
U06E5049DMH,Today in class we spoke on how blood is a shear thinning biofluid. What does this mean then when we take blood thinners? Do the medications take someone to out of out blood to make them less viscous or lower the rate in which our blood flows?
U06DYE17370,"Interesting question, in looking it up it seems that blood thinners generally don't alter the thickness or viscosity of blood which I found surprising, It instead makes it harder for the blood to form clots by doing things such as blocking the action of vitamin K."
U06DYE17370,"In class today we talked about pollinators such as butterflies and the sugar concentrations in nectar. I was wondering if there are instances where the sugar concentrations change and therefore the pollinators adapt or die off, and what that adaptation would look like?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"In lecture today, we talked about viscosity and specifically how it applied to blood in the human body. How does the human body account for differences in  hematocrit as the environment outside of the body continuously changes?"
U06DYE1AMN2,"In lecture we talked about how temperature, concentration of solutes and shear rate affect viscosity.  I know there are other factors (like pressure), but I am most curious about how time affects viscosity.  How does aging or mechanical stress (via wear and tear) affect viscosity?  I am trying to picture something like a jar of honey with high viscosity and it becoming easier/harder to pour over time.  Is it always going to get easier to pour it, harder to pour it or can it be either?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"How do the principles of fluid dynamics apply differently to animals moving through air versus water, given the differences in density and viscosity of these fluids, and can anyone give examples of convergent evolutionary strategies in unrelated species?"
U06E53GQSN6,"How do the principles of fluid dynamics and mechanics shape the evolutionary strategies of birds in flight, particularly in terms of wing morphology, feather structure, and flight patterns, and how do these adaptations optimize their efficiency, maneuverability, and energy expenditure in various ecological contexts, and how could this be theoretically studied?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"When we talked about blood and blood doping, it made me wonder about drug development. Do fluid mechanics have to be taken into account for intravenous delivery methods (like IVs, injections, dialysis)? What are factors to control for? How can blood flow not be significantly altered at the site of access (for example, reducing the added turbulent flow)?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"Your question had me thinking, so I did some research to see how fluid mechanics play into medical procedures. I found that fluid mechanics do indeed play a crucial role in intravenous therapies like IVs and injections. Medical professionals need to consider several factors to ensure safe and effective drug delivery. These include the viscosity of the medication, the flow rate at which it's administered, and the size of the needle or catheter. The goal is to achieve a seamless integration of the medication into the bloodstream, avoiding any disruption to normal blood flow or causing turbulence at the injection site. Choosing the right site for access and ensuring the medication is at body temperature can also help minimize potential issues."
U06E7GRA8P6,"Today we talked about fluid mechanics and its relation to viscosity and blood. I know that temperature affects viscosity but I wonder, how does this mechanism differ in cold-blooded animals concerning hibernation? Is there some sort of evolutionary significance in maintaining body temperature?"
U06EHN55XSM,"How does temperature influence the viscosity of water, and subsequently, how does this change affect the swimming velocity of fish in warmer or colder waters?"
U06E5068859,"Since Blood can get more viscous at lower temperatures, is there a danger placed when storing blood for longer periods of time that would cause for concern?"
U06EHN55XSM,"One way the body regulates its hematocrit levels is through the hormone erythropoietin (EPO), which is produced by the kidneys in response to low oxygen levels in the blood. When the body perceives a decrease in oxygen availability, such as at higher altitudes or during physical exertion, the kidneys release more EPO into the bloodstream. EPO stimulates the bone marrow to produce more red blood cells, leading to an increase in hematocrit. This response enhances the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity, helping the body cope with reduced oxygen levels."
U06E5068859,The molecular adhesion part comes from the frogs mucus that it excretes from the almost suction cup like toe pads where the sticky substance allows for better grip as well as the toe pads being covered in tiny compressable hairs that allows for them to stick to almost anything.
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi Amy, it seems that temperature and viscosity have an inverse relationship. Viscosity decreases as temperature increases. For me, this makes sense when considering wax-like substances, which become more liquified as heat is applied. When considering this in relation to the speed at which fish can swim, it appears that some studies have shown that fish swim faster in warmer waters. "
U06DYDZ4C2J,How does the amount of sunlight hitting the water impact its viscosity? Does it have a similar effect as temperature (more sunlight = higher temperature = less viscous)?
U06E25K0NH3,"Today in class we talked about the ""sweet spot"" for the percentage of sucrose to be produced in a plant's nectar in order for an insect to be able to suction the flood and pollinize. I don't know if this is a ""what came first, the chicken or the egg"" type of question, but did the evolution of the insect's proboscis lead to the evolution of the plants percentage of sucrose, or was it the opposite, with the percentage of the sucrose leading to the evolution of the circumference of the proboscis?"
U06E53G8R42,"Today in class we talked about non-newtonian fluids that are present in biomechanical systems. Synovial fluid is an example of a shear thickening fluid found in vertebrates that increases in thickness with applied shearing forces within a joint capsule. How does the viscosity of synovial fluid in a joint such as a human knee change under different conditions such as jumping, running, or walking?"
U06E4H17N03,"Hey Andrew! I found that after blood is collected from donors, red blood cells are isolated from the blood and stored at 4°C in a solution containing anti-clotting agents and nutrients, which allows the cells to survive for several weeks (up to 42 days) before transfusion. Viscosity change due to temp wouldn't matter here because the blood is always warmed back up before transfusion. BUT, during this storage, red blood cells remain biologically active and gradually use up their energy stores. The red blood cell membranes become more fragile, and some cells burst, releasing their contents into the storage bag. This fragility leads to release of cell-free hemoglobinn and these accumulated changes are referred to as the “storage lesion”. If I'm not oversimplifying, I think since blood viscosity increases as hematocrit/hemoglobin increases, storing blood for long periods of time may increase its viscosity. Despite all these changes, viscosity would not be the most relevant factor, and I found differing studies on whether or not ""old blood"" is just as effective/safe as ""new blood"".   Side note, most blood donations are used well before that time anyways -"
U06DQAKCBBR,"Humans have different blood types, would there be a notable difference within blood types when it comes to viscosity properties as we discussed in class you think ?"
U06E4H17N03,"Since bees are responsible for majority of pollination in flowering plants, why would plants adapt for the long probosics length of butterflies as mentioned in class? Butterflies are less efficient than bees at moving pollen between plants, so wouldn't it be more of a reproductive advantage to cater to bees? I guess I'm wondering about the comparison between proboscis of butterflies and bees as well and how that determines nectar viscosity in most plants."
U06DQAKCBBR,"I definitely think that there are times when variations in the sugar content of nectar cause pollinators to adapt or even go extinct. Pollinators can adjust by changing the way they forage for flowers that have higher sugar concentrations or by creating physiological systems that can more effectively process blossoms with lower sugar concentrations. However, certain pollinators might not be able to adapt quickly enough and could experience population decreases or even extinction if the changes are too abrupt or rapid."
U06GBE40483,"Is fluid viscosity in biological systems including the human circulatory system and synovial joint capsules primarily genetically determined or is it the result of lifestyle choices? For example, synovial fluid viscosity is proportional to inflammation. Does the viscosity of the fluid in these systems vary greatly between species to fulfill different functions/needs?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"There definitely would be differences in viscosity, since blood types are differentiated based on factors present on the red blood cells or not, but I doubt viscosity is substantially (i.e. in a medical setting) affected by this. I think the only cases where this might be problematic would be serious blood disorders, especially if blood cells are over- or underproduced."
U06ETSCDGAC,I would think that the amount of sunlight hitting the water would have an impact on its viscosity. Water that experiences more direct contact with the sunlight will be warmer and will thus have a lower viscosity than water that is cooler.
U06E25K0NH3,"This is an interesting question. I believe, after some research, that cold-blooded species that hibernate have the same mechanics as our blood, which is as our body temperature drops, the viscosity rises. I know that these animal's metabolism drops significantly in order to cope with the lack of nutrients being introduced to their systems. There body temps are essentially the same as their surroundings when hibernating, but to deal with this, they have special adaptations to maintain life."
U06E7GRQFUL,"Aging can affect viscosity in the way that some fluids may go through chemical changes over time, as well as the sensitivity to temperature over time, including contamination to the fluid with aging."
U06GBE40483,"At rest, synovial fluid has a high viscosity. During lower-speed movements such as walking, shearing forces increase and shear thinning occur resulting in decreased synovial fluid viscosity. During running and jumping, shearing forces are greater resulting in even lower synovial fluid viscosity."
U06DYE1AMN2,"Factors such as body size, activity level, and evolutionary adaptations do influence the viscosity of fluids in biological systems across different species.  For example, species with larger body sizes or higher levels of physical activity may require fluids with different viscosity levels to support their unique physiological demands."
U06EHN30DDF,"water is more dense and viscous than air, so there's more drag. Thus, animals may generate and maintain movement differently, such as through undulation or oscillations to minimize drag."
U06E53G8R42,"Although bees are a major pollinator for flowering plants and the plants bees and butterflies prefer to feed on have some overlap, bees feed on nectar as well as pollen; therefore, the bees which ingest nectar through a proboscis still benefit from the dilute sugar solution in the nectar and also provide an extra benefit to the flower in the form of higher rates of reproductive success. By keeping the solution dilute, any organism that feeds on nectar with a proboscis will benefit, meanwhile a more dilute solution will require more frequent feedings by the animal and further increase the rate of pollination."

U06DYE1AMN2,"In class today we talked about the difference between laminar and turbulent. Is it possible for something to be both?  Can laminar and turbulent exist in the same tube?  

Also we learned that <500 is laminar and >500 is turbulent"
U06E5068859,"In class today we discussed how high Reynolds numbers lead to erratic turbulent flow that can make the object in motion unpredixtable due to the changing drag. With how fast bullets travel with their size, how is this mitigated in order to make them as accurate as they are. With their fast speed, I would assume it would be hard to keep them on target."

U06EHN30DDF,"In class today we talked about Reynolds number and the importance of viscosity to relative internal movement within a fluid. How might Reynolds number influence morphology and swimming strategies of organisms of different sizes, such as fish and invertebrates?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"How does the corkscrew motion of sperm, an adaptation to high viscous environments, compare to the locomotion strategies of microorganisms in similar or varying viscous environments?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"Bullets are designed for accuracy despite high speeds and potential turbulence by incorporating streamlined shapes for reduced air resistance, spin stabilization from rifling in gun barrels for gyroscopic stability, and optimized mass distribution to ensure steady flight. These features counteract the effects of turbulent flow and maintain the bullet's intended trajectory."
U06E7GRQFUL,How does the Reynolds number influence the way a human swims opposed to smaller fishes and organisms?
U06E53GQSN6,Was the preconceived notion that sperm propel themselves by undulating their tails based on observing tadpoles swim since they are similar in design?
U06DYE17370,"Larger organisms like humans have a higher Reynolds number than smaller organisms like small fishes. This difference in Reynolds number more so denotes the pressure versus shear stress difference and not the way the organism swims. However shape does have a larger effect on pressure drag, so organisms that have a larger Reynolds number are often more streamlined in appearance."
U06DYE17370,In class today we talked about down feather in relation to baby birds and decreasing their velocity. I was wondering if there is another example of an organism's young having a physical attribute to decrease their drag?
U06E53G8R42,"We have previously discussed sea kraits, or aquatic snakes. Sea kraits spend a majority of their time on land and must hold their breath to go underwater and feed. How might some of the adaptations to life at sea such as a paddle like tail affect the mobility of kraits on land? In the water, the kraits depend on the viscosity of the water but on land they rely on slithering and friction."
U06DYDZ4C2J,"How does abnormal morphology impact the movement of sperm (two tails, coiled tails)?"
U06E53G8R42,"Anton van Leeuwenhoek the inventor of the first compound microscope saw that sperm flagella appeared to undulate in a snake-like fashion which without 3-D microscopy is an optical illusion. Since the flagella appeared to flick back and forth, the initial thought was that the flagella was undulating like a tadpole or snake tail; however, this was due to the two dimensional view of the corkscrew swimming process where the flagella only rotates in one direction that limited Leeuwenhoek's perception of how spermatozoa swim."
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class today , we talked a lot about the Reynolds number. How did certain fish like sail fish and tuna evolutionary adapt to become some of the fastest species and thus change their Reynolds number? What, in regards to their Reynolds number and drag, allows them to swim so fast?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"I would think that abnormal morphology would greatly impact the movement of sperms. It would likely be detrimental, and thus it would lead to improper movement of the sperm and prevent fertilization."
U06DQAKCBBR,"How may D'Alembert's Paradox contradict our knowledge of lift generation and flow behavior around an airfoil, and what solutions have been suggested for this intricate aerodynamic phenomenon?"
U06E7GRKB7W,"If temperature affects viscosity, can it impact Reynolds number? Are there any practical applications for this?"
U06DQAKCBBR,"Yes I think that it is true that viscosity, and thus the Reynolds number, can be influenced by temperature. For most fluids, viscosity usually decreases with temperature. This implies that a fluid's viscosity and flow resistance may decrease with increasing temperature, changing the Reynolds number of the fluid. Thus, temperature-related changes in viscosity can have an impact on a fluid's Reynolds number and flow characteristics. An example perhaps of this is the way heat exchangers and pipelines are designed; variations in temperature can influence the viscosity of the fluid passing through them, which can have an effect on the flow pattern and heat transfer efficiency."
U06E4H17N03,"I missed class today, can someone explain what inviscid means and how it was applied to the concepts discussed today?"
U06EHN55XSM,"What are some examples of physical adaptations in the early life stages of marine animals, like jellyfish or plankton, that help reduce drag and enhance their ability to navigate through water currents efficiently?"
U06EHN55XSM,"I was reading about some other organism's that have early adaptations and found interesting information on spiderlings. Spiderlings use a technique called ""ballooning"" to disperse and colonize new areas by releasing silk threads into the air, and the drag force on these silk strands allows the spiderlings to be carried by the wind. The silk threads decrease the velocity at which the spiderlings fall and enable them to travel over long distances."
U06E25K0NH3,"In one of the slides from tuesday's lecture, it listed the the different Reynolds numbers across different organisms and organs. It shows that the brain has a lower Re than the heart, is this due to different viscosities in which the blood is moving? Or is it higher near the heart because that is the origin from which blood is pushed throughout the body?"
U06GBE40483,How does reynolds number vary for abnormal sperm phenotypes
U06DYDZ4C2J,Hi Amy! One cool way plankton reduce drag is by jumping out of the water (
U06EHN30DDF,"In class, we talked about how a streamlined body shape can reduce drag by minimizing the disturbance of water around their bodies, including the plate-in-water example. Fish that minimize drag also have adaptations such as muscle efficiency and flexible fins/tails for maneuverability. "
U06DYE1AMN2,"The paddle-like tail, optimized for swimming, may impede the sea krait's ability to slither efficiently on land due to increased drag and resistance against the ground.  This is because the tails lack the flexibility and agility needed for effective movement on land, resulting in reduced mobility and efficiency during slithering on terrestrial surfaces."
U06E7GRQFUL,"Abnormal morphology would definitely impact the movement of sperm, and may impair their motility and lead to irregular swimming patterns and deceased velocity, and could reduce their chances of successful fertilization."

U06E7GRKB7W,"At the tip of the wings, if the fluid goes to low pressure and goes up, how do birds adapt their flight feathers for stability in flight to reduce this induced drag?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"Birds reduce induced drag and enhance flight efficiency through several adaptations: they spread their wingtip feathers like aircraft winglets, use the alula to prevent stalling, benefit from high aspect ratio wings like albatrosses for less drag, and flexibly adjust wing shape for optimal aerodynamics. These strategies improve lift and stability in flight."
U06DFH8NV0R,"Considering the impact of air viscosity on momentum and lift, how might aquatic birds that transition between water and air, such as pelicans or puffins, have evolved specific wing features to manage these differences in viscosity and maximize efficiency during takeoff and landing?"
U06DQAKCBBR,"For a bird if there feathers were rained on, for a bird that doesn't necessarily live near the ocean, how would the lift be affected or would it not be?"
U06EHN52RG9,"How are the wings of piscivorous diving birds (not surface hunters), specifically osprey, adapted so that they are able to both stoop, dive into the water and capture their prey, then emerge and takeoff again?

U06DFEQBJRF,Such a great question!!!
U06E7GRQFUL,How are birds able to utilize their wing shape to minimize drag and optimize lift?
U06E53GQSN6,"How are wing shape, flapping speed, and air speed all correlated for birds?"
U06E5049DMH,"This seems wrong, but would it be more economically sound for wings of planes to conform to be thinner “smaller chord” when in the air after take off? Or does the massive body make this impossible?"
U06E25K0NH3,"When talking about the different types of wings in class today, say between a chicken and an albatross, what effect do wind speeds have on their lift? I would assume that an albatross lives in an environment with significantly more wind, but if a chicken was put in this habitat, would they be able to glide better? Or would their shorter wing length still not allow them to soar as well?"
U06E7GRA8P6,"For something like a hummingbird that requires continuous and quick flapping, how does the length of their wings and speed of flapping correlate with drag and efficiency?"
U06DYE1AMN2,Today in class we talked about flight and lift
U06E5068859,"When taking lift into question and seeing how much can be created before a stall, does velocity impact this? Because planes can usually go faster and have a larger angle of attack but have to speed up if going too slow."
U06E5068859,"I think that wings can get smaller until the point that it becomes unsafe for them to shrink due to damage to the wings, they are already quite small compared to the mass and volume of the fuelsalage."

U06EHN30DDF,"how might wing morphology in birds generate different levels of lift, such as cruising, climbing, or maneuvering?"
U06DYE17370,"In class today we talked about planes and their ability to lift. I was wondering how turbulence effects this, does it change the amount of pressure present on the wings?"
U06EHN55XSM,Why is it that some birds have to flap their wings more frequently while others seem to be able to glide through the air?
U06DYE17370,"Generally, bird's feet get tucked in during flight. But if the bird's feet were to hang down it would create extra air resistance, slowing down flight velocity."
U06EHN55XSM,"The wings of flightless birds could help with thermoregulation. For example, penguins use their wings to cover their chicks and shield themselves from harsh weather conditions. They could further use their wings for swimming and diving for food. The shape of penguin wings is probably more adapted for efficient movement through water rather than air."
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class on last Thursday, we talked about the use of dimples on golf balls and how it reduces the drag on the ball. What might be the limitations in using dimples on other things like cars, airplanes, or boats?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"Some birds likely have to flap their wings more than other birds because of the difference in their chord lengths and thus aspect ratio. As the aspect ratio increases, the bird generates. more and more lift and thus would have to flap their wings less. Another factor is the weight of the bird because a bird that has a heavier body frame will likely need to flap more to stay in the air."
U06E4H17N03,"Had to miss class today and am looking over the slides, can someone explain the concept of upwash and downwash in regards to lift tradeoffs?"
U06E4H17N03,"Firstly, we talked about how the dimples help to reduce drag by creating a turbulent boundary layer of air around the ball, but this only happens at certain Reynolds numbers. At Reynolds numbers below about 4 x 10⁴, the flow around a golf ball is laminar (smooth, orderly layers of fluid flowing over the surface of the ball) At Reynolds numbers above about 4 x 10⁵, the flow around a golf ball is turbulent (chaotic, disordered eddies of fluid flowing over the surface of the ball). So the dimpling is only effective for certain speeds, but you did ask about cars, planes, and boats which can travel pretty fast, so I found an "
U06E7GRKB7W,"So essentially we talked about lift and how that occurs in foils (ie wings). The lift comes from pressure differences over the chord of the wing, but as the wing extends, there are still pressure differences at the tip. This creates vorteces at the tip (the air goes up) and results in an induced drag. The idea of up/down-wash depends on the angle of attack of the wing - but we focused more on drag during class."
U06E25K0NH3,"I would think that turbulence would definitely affect the pressure across the wings, which could lead to a loss of lift as their could be pockets of less airflow over the wings (causing a dip/ falling of the airplane?). I know we talked in class about how the difference in air velocity above and below the wings creates lift, and I'm sure that the instability of air flow in turbulence would greatly affect lift and drag during small spurts of time, resulting in the bumpiness experienced in planes."
U06GBE40483,"I had to miss class on Tuesday so I apologize if this was already covered. Does wing shape and features vary in different bird species depending on their flying needs? For example, migrating bird species often depend on gliding to decrease energy expenditure."
U06E53GQSN6,"Wing shape and features vary greatly among bird species based on their specific flying needs. For instance, birds that engage in long migrations often have wings optimized for gliding to conserve energy, while birds that rely on quick maneuvers, like hunting birds of prey, tend to have wings designed for agility and speed. Additionally, factors such as habitat, diet, and hunting techniques also influence wing shape and features in birds."
U06E7GRQFUL,"I would think wing morphology would play a crucial role in generating lift. For example, birds with long wings would probably be more well adapted for gliding over long distances while birds with shorter wings would have wings that are optimal for maneuverability allowing them to change direction quickly throughout flight."
U06DQAKCBBR,"In terms of wing length, the hummingbird can produce more upward force with each flap thanks to its longer wings' ability to generate greater lift, helping them stay in the air longer and navigate more skillfully. Hummingbirds are renowned for their exceptionally rapid flapping, which can reach over 50 times per second which allows them to hover and move more precisely when it flaps faster because it can create more lift. A hummingbird's ability to maximize lift and reduce drag determines how efficient its flight is. Basically a bird's ideal wing length and flapping speed might change according on its size, species, and the tasks it must complete, including hovering. Hope that helps!"
U06EHN30DDF,"I think wing shape, flapping speed, and airspeed are all correlated and related to the ecological niche that the bird inhabits. For instance, a hummingbird is a nectar-feeding hovering bird so they have higher metabolism, faster flapping sleep, and unique wing morphology. "
U06EMNFUDFW,"To your second question:
With age, our bones have a harder time healing. Vascular perfusion to our bones decreases with age, affecting our ability to regenerate. Generally, as we age our levels of ossification are also increased, and inflammatory regulation, cellular differentiation, and signaling cascades are also impacted by age.

As for gender, studies seem to point to the conclusion that men generally heal better, and are less likely to suffer from something like Osteoporosis. Women, particularly post-menopausal women, are found to have a higher incidence of fracture compared to older men. Yet, one study claims that men seem to suffer from worse outcomes - so maybe they only heal better in younger adults? It's thought that variation in sex hormone levels could potentially play a role in this. Although, some studies seem to deny any influence of sex in fracture healings, and overall it seems to vary depending on the specific type of fracture."
U06EMNFUDFW,"I think heavy winds, headwinds particularly, would help to increase lift during take-off and landing, but I don't think it would have an affect while the chicken was airborne, because the wind would also mean that they'd definitely have to work harder."
U06EMNFUDFW,"Wing kinematics tell us that during takeoff birds will direct drag up and back, while lift is directed up and forward. But how they manipulate drag and lift changes while they are in lift, and then again when they are landing. While lift initially opposes drag (in order to accelerate the bird forward during takeoff),  it then assists drag to decelerate the bird before landing. I think that birds adjust their wing shape and posture, extending or contracting, depending on how they are trying manipulate lift and drag."
U06E7GRA8P6,I think that the angle of attack has a greater impact on stall than velocity. Actually I think that an increase in speed results in more lift which reduces the angle of attack which reduces overall drag. Maybe I'm misunderstanding but I think that lift can be affected by both angle and velocity but in different scenarios.
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi Ari, it seems that usually birds feathers are waterproof, but when it's raining that causes the air to be less dense and therefore more difficult to achieve lift.  ("
U06GBE40483,"Longer wing shapes are advantageous for birds that primarily use their wings for flight whereas shorter wings are advantageous for swimming underwater. Aquatic birds have achieved an optimal balance between these two wing phenotypes. In addition, highly flexible wing joints are advantageous for aquatic birds."
U06E53G8R42,"In class on Tuesday we discussed aspect ratio and how the wing shape of a bird like an albatross, which is suited for gliding long distances with minimal flapping, might be an advantage in certain environments such as the open ocean where these birds live; however, what this wing design provides to the bird in gliding ability and distance it lacks as a tradeoff in maneuverability where a bird like a quail with a lower aspect ratio might excel. Quails, which live in more forested environments are better suited for maneuverability and short gliding flight due to their lower aspect ratio."
U06GBE40483,"What adaptations do fish spines have in terms of structure, flexibility, and composition that allow them to achieve repetitive side to side motion while swimming"
U06E25K0NH3,"Does depth, or water type (salt/freshwater) effect the swimming locomotion? If not, what would be the driving factor in the evolution/adaptation of swimming locomotion?"
U06EHN30DDF,what other physiological adaptations in addition to metabolic efficiency could contribute to the migratory endurance of American and European eels?
U06E5068859,I was wondering if rays move in the same style of locomotion as fish since they do not have the typcal sturcture of a fish as well as what other examples of fish that may not follow this motion are?
U06E5068859,"From what I can see, a major factor to the motion is the spine being the primary horizontal bone in the fish while cartilage supports the structure radiating out from the spine. Smaller bones do exist but are not as large or span the length of the fish. This allows fish to be less impeded for their motion and allow muscles to shift the entire body."
U06E53GQSN6,How might advancements in our understanding of swimming modes and kinematics lead to improvements in biomimetic underwater propulsion systems?
U06DFH8NV0R,"How do sensory systems in fish, such as lateral lines or vision, influence their swimming efficiency and maneuverability in complex fluid environments?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"Advancements in understanding fish swimming modes and kinematics can certainly lead to more efficient and adaptable underwater propulsion systems, mimicking fish's ability to efficiently navigate through various aquatic environments (just like Prof Kenaley's story about his mentor George being approached by the Navy to make their ships navigate thru fluids as efficiently as tuna do). Incorporating these biological insights can improve the maneuverability, speed, and energy efficiency of underwater vehicles and robots. This biomimetic approach can enhance the performance of these systems in tasks like oceanographic exploration, environmental monitoring, and underwater infrastructure inspection."
U06DYDZ4C2J,"In class, Professor Kenaley mentioned that the navy wanted to study Thunniform's swimming technique since they have the highest propulsive efficiency. Has any study released data related to this research yet?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"In class, it was mentioned that it was very difficult but possible to measure the force a bolus of water applies onto the fish when it is swimming. What kind of set up or equipment would have to be used to measure this force? Additionally, how might it scale in relation to bigger or smaller fish?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"I would think that the depth of water would affect swimming locomotion as there would be a greater pressure as a fish swims deeper and deeper. A greater pressure would likely make it more difficult for swimming locomotion. Additionally, saltwater and freshwater have different densities, so I feel like the type of water would also affect the swimming locomotion."
U06DYE17370,"In class today we talked about eel migration and how they move so efficiently that they use little to no energy. I was wondering if there are any other examples of this conservation of energy during migration, and whether this phenomenon can only be observed in water?"
U06DYE17370,"In looking it up, I did find some studies regarding Thunniform's swimming technique, and some in regards to the building of better performing machines. I could not find much information on how the navy has implemented this, as more research might have to be done."
U06E7GRKB7W,"I believe rays tend to swim in an vertical undulatory manner rather than what we saw today - this might be an adaptation in terms of feeding style (I think they rely on the element of surprise to hunt) and simply a different way to maintain/generate buoyancy/lift in water. Also they tend to be demersal rather than pelagic, so there is the need to be able to blend in with the flat seabed, which could contribute to their morphology."
U06E7GRQFUL,"What other animals, besides for eels, are able to conserve their energy in the water? What about out of water, or is this not possible?"
U06E7GRA8P6,Are there any other animals that conserve their energy in a similar way to eels? Does the ability to go for long periods of time without food contribute to energy conservation or is there some other mechanism?
U06E53G8R42,"Today in class we discussed the continuum of different swimming forms such as anguilliform, carangiform, and ostraciliform. How does a fish like a giant ocean sunfish or Mola mola which requires two fins for propulsion on either side of the body (ventral and dorsal) fit within this continuum?"
U06E5049DMH,"Since it is easier for eels to swim without using much energy at all, does this mean that eels would be more efficient in other more dense mediums as well compared to other fish?"
U06DYE1AMN2,In class today we talked about eels swimming to the Caribbean hot spot area for breeding
U06EHN52RG9,"What different adaptations do eels have that allow them to transition from freshwater to saltwater habitats (specifically when they are adults, not when they are developing as glass eels)? How does their physiology change and what does the metabolic cost of osmoregulation look like when they move between freshwater and saltwater?"
U06DQAKCBBR,Can someone just highlight the importance of the Karman gait again and does this apply to only a certain group of fish?
U06EHN55XSM,"Whales, similar to eels, have long migration periods. Do whales and eels share similar morphology or physiology that allows them to be very energy efficient?"
U06E53G8R42,"Hi Ariana, the Karman Dead Trout Gait is important because it emphasizes the difference in vortices that are formed from a drag wake versus a propulsion wake. In the Karman Gait, the fish is dead, implying that the body (fish) is not displacing any volume of water with a propulsive force and that any motion of the body must be from the fluid acting on the body. What is significant about the Karman gait is that without drag wake vortices, an observer would expect the dead fish to be pushed in the same direction of the water current, but this is not observed. Instead the presence of the dowel in front of the fish (the dowel could be exchanged for a rock in a river in an ecological system) creates predictable vortices in the water downstream that spiral towards the midline of the fish and create a velocity vector back in the direction of the dowel. The buoyant body of the fish gets caught bouncing between these alternating, predictable vortices and experiences a form of thrust towards the dowel against the current without providing any propulsive force of its own. This represents a way in which live fish, of no particular species, could use this property of drag vortices to conserve energy and move in the desired direction."
U06EHN55XSM,Turtles are capable of long distance migrations in the ocean and having efficient swimming strokes to conserve energy. They also employ rest periods or periods of slower swimming to conserve energy.
U06EHN30DDF,I know whales/dolphins undergo periods of fasting and migratory birds can employ efficient flying adaptations like soaring or gliding. Energy conservation allows animals to survive periods of food scarcity or environmental difficulties.
U06DQAKCBBR,"The streamlined body of whales enable them to travel more efficiently in the water by reducing drag. Additionally, their thick coat of blubber acts as insulation and stores energy—both of which are critical during lengthy migrations during which food may not be easily accessible. Furthermore, whales are recognized for their capacity to control their metabolic rate and even to go into a relaxed awareness state, which is a kind of ""sleep"" that lowers activity and helps preserve energy throughout migration. Fish that resemble snakes and have longer bodies are called eels, and they too have lower drag. Long-distance migrations between freshwater and saltwater habitats are a distinctive aspect of their life cycle. To survive during these migrations, eels are able to store energy in their muscles and liver. Their bodies are also designed to swim well, thanks to an intricate network of muscles and fins that allow them to navigate the water with ease. They therefore save energy somewhat differently, despite certain similarities."
U06E5049DMH,Good question. With some research it seems that they do this to keep their young from harm 
U06DYDZ4C2J,"Hi Tess! It looks like as hatchlings, the eels ""leaflike"" shape contributes to their ease in following the currents. As the eels mature, their ability to migrate effectively is aided by camouflage. However, according to one study from 2004, ""Endurance swimming of European eel,"" ""a low cost of swimming combined with a fat content of >13%is crucial for the capacity of the eel to swim across the ocean.""

"
U06DYDZ4C2J,How does a bird adapt to flying/moving when a single wing is injured or damaged?
U06ETSCDGAC,"Before break, we talked about how eels were so efficient in their migration to and from their breeding grounds. Are there any other migratory species that are as efficient as eels? Additionally, how might we be able to apply the efficiency of eels to human mechanical creations?"
U06ETSCDGAC,"If a bird's wing is injured or damage, my guess would be that the other wing would work to compensate for the injury; however, the bird would not fly nearly as well. The bird may develop better ground skills as it will have to walk more because of the injury."
U06DQAKCBBR,I'm not sure whether this was covered in previous discussions if so can someone remind me how do various bird wings with their variety of shapes account for the drag produced by wind flowing from various angles or directions?
U06EHN30DDF,"how might flight biomechanics differ among birds that are adapted for different climates or higher altitudes, especially with regard to wing shape and aspect ratio?"
U06EHN30DDF,"I know monarch butterflies undertake long migrations, though they tend to be multi-generational. This example is obviously different from eels but they use wind currents/thermal updrafts to maximize efficiency. We can apply eel efficiency to human mechanical creations by modeling the streamlined body and undulating motion of eels to maximize efficiency in underwater environments."
U06DYE1AMN2,We talked in class about the two groups of birds to use in the mini project
U06E5049DMH,"Other than wings for birds, what else about their shape makes them aerodynamic to lessen the air resistance they may occur? Does the shape of their head and beak make it easier to slice through the air, or do they do something to say tuck their head?"
U06E5049DMH,"Due to their prey being in the water, they have very dense and large bodies and are made up of much fat. Do to their short wings and large bodies, there "
U06EHN55XSM,Birds typically have streamlines bodies which help to make them more aerodynamic. Their tails can also be used to control their flight and adjust air resistance; they can spread their tail feathers to increase drag for slowing down or fold them in tightly to reduce drag for faster flight.
U06EHN55XSM,"How does wing loading, the ratio of a bird's body mass to its wing area, affect its ability to fly?"
U06DFH8NV0R,"Birds adapted to different climates and altitudes exhibit varying flight biomechanics, particularly in wing shape and aspect ratio, to optimize for energy efficiency and maneuverability. For example, birds in cold, open environments often have longer wings with higher aspect ratios for efficient long-distance flight, while those in dense forests possess shorter, rounded wings for better agility. High-altitude flyers, like some raptors, have large wing surface areas to maximize lift in thinner air, facilitating soaring with minimal energy expenditure."
U06DFH8NV0R,How does the lateral line system in sharks influence their biomechanics and hunting efficiency in low visibility environments?
U06E7GRKB7W,I think it might have to do with birds modulating their angle of attack (the angle the wing forms with the current) which can help minimize drag. Otherwise certain features (like a specific aspect ratio) could be selected for - like in the case of the albatross.
U06E7GRKB7W,"How do birds maximize energy for flight, especially in terms of powered flight? Do birds who fly differently (i.e. albatross vs. say a sparrow) have different adaptations other than the wings? If not, what is special about the avian respiratory and circulatory systems?"
U06E53GQSN6,"What are the biomechanical adaptations in the wings of flightless birds, and how do these adaptations influence their locomotion, foraging strategies, and survival in their respective environments?"
U06DYE17370,Before break we talked about the Strouhal number in relation to the swimming of fish and propulsion efficiency. I'm a little confused on the topic of the Strouhal number and how it relates to the movement of fish in terms of the shed vortices.
U06DYE17370,"The wing loading affects the bird's take off, landing, and stalling speeds. Low wing loading means that the birth can fly slower and still obtain enough lift while large wing loading means that the bird has to fly faster in order to maintain enough lift to stay in the air."
U06E7GRQFUL,"What are the major aspects or characteristics that impacts a bird's ability to fly, other than wings?"
U06E5068859,"I know that Penguins have adapted their wings to use for swimming efficiency, but what other wings have uses not primarily for flying?"
U06E5068859,The hollow bones reduce the weight of the bird and the shape of feathers on the leading edge of wings are able to increase the lift of the bird themselves.
U06E25K0NH3,I know that there are birds that dive from the sky and essentially swim through water to catch prey. How have their wings adapted to accommodate both the air and the water?
U06E4H17N03,"I am also still confused on Strouhal number, can someone explain? How does it relate to both Froude number and Reynolds number, if related?"
U06E4H17N03,"I found that plenty of species of ducks, geese, swans, cranes, ibises, parrots, falcons, kiwis, songbirds, etc are flightless, and many of which are powerful runners or skilled swimmers aided by their wings. For example, ostriches use their wings sort of like rudders to help them steer while running. Some other uses of wings in flightless birds are tucking their heads beneath them for warmth, sheltering eggs with them, and flapping them towards potential mates. Interestingly, the common ancester of all birds could fly. Many independent species lost their ability to fly in situations such as when he species migrates to a new area where it doesnt face pressures to fly, it  stops flying over a few generations. Then the flighlessness will affect their body shape and will change over thousands of years to match this new behavior, and the wings just become vesitigal structures.  Hope this helps!"
U06GBE40483,How does bird wing efficiency vary across species ?
U06GBE40483,"I think it is difficult to say. As the density of the medium increases, the resistance encountered by the fish would also increase. Some deep sea fish which live in high pressure environments may have better adaptations for swimming in high density mediums  compared to eels"
U06E53G8R42,How does the thrust force due to undulatory locomotion of a swimming fish in water relate to or differ from the slithering undulatory locomotion of a snake? How much does it differ between land snakes and sea snakes or eels?
U06DQAKCBBR,"Diving birds, including ducks, feature streamlined wings designed to minimize drag in both air and water, enabling agile movement underwater. Their robust wing muscles provide the necessary power for propulsion and pursuit of prey beneath the surface. With wings characterized by rigidity, these birds maintain stability during flight and swimming underwater. Specialized feathers, equipped with waterproof coatings, ensure buoyancy and flight readiness post-dive. Utilizing mechanisms such as expelling air from their lungs or compressing air sacs, diving birds regulate buoyancy, facilitating rapid descent underwater. Certain species, like diving ducks, exhibit specific wing adaptations such as shorter and pointed wings, enhancing their agility for takeoff and maneuvering below the water's surface. These combined adaptations empower diving birds to efficiently hunt for prey in both aerial and aquatic realms. Hope this helps."
U06E25K0NH3,"After doing some research, and looking back at some lectures, I think there are a few important factors that affect bird wing efficiency across species. Wing shape and flight style are both very important aspects. Wings that are longer and and narrower allow for better soaring, thus making them more efficient (an albatross for example). Another important factor would be where the birds are flying, say along migration routes. Different winds can allow for more efficient flights across long distances."
U06DYE1AMN2,"
Swimming fish generate thrust by undulating their bodies and fins against the water. In contrast, slithering snakes on land use lateral undulation, pushing against irregularities in the ground to propel themselves forward, while aquatic snakes and eels employ similar undulatory movements adapted for navigating through denser water environments"
U06E7GRQFUL,"Bird wing efficiency can vary according to wing shape, the efficiency of flight muscles that can vary among bird species (some may be better adapted for long distances or maneuverability), as well the size of the bird and body mass."
U06GBE40483,"Strouhal’s number is relevant to fish swimming because it describes the efficiency of their propulsion through a medium. In terms of vortices shed, the strouhal number is related to the oscillatory frequency of their motion to generation thrust. The oscillatory motion produces the vortices."
U06DYDZ4C2J,"The lateral line is critical as it enables sharks to sense water movement and changes in pressure via neuromasts, which grant them the ability to detect movement of prey while hunting as well as a better understanding of their environment. With this in mind, it seems that low visibility wouldn't be a problem or interfere with the lateral line system as it is solely based on factors such as low-frequency vibrations, not visibility.
