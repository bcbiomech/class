U0887F68Q8P,"For AME1, What does “method=lm” mean during the plotting? What are other coding command methods when plotting?"
U088FCMFG9L,I think the “method=lm” code tells the geom_smooth command to apply a linear model to your data set. It is what tells r that you wish to have a linear best-fit line applied to your data under the geom_smooth framework.
U088FCMFG9L,What do the dark and light grey-shaded areas surrounding the best-fit lines and data in the geom_point plot represent? They appeared when I generated my plot in the AME and I’m not sure what they mean (discussion).
U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi all, the solution for ame1 is posted and the password in “sol1”. You can find the solution under our “AMEs” tab in the assignments tab atop the site"
U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi All, AME 2 is released with the passwork “iris”. Good luck!!"

U088N1B170S,"For AME1, the graph for jump height vs time for the two participants, does anyone have any methods on how to make the ‘geom_smooth’ more visible compared to the raw data points? My initial thought was to reduce the size or transparency of the data points but was wondering if people used other methods. (discussion)"
U088N1DJDS6,You can change the size of geom_smooth by inputting size into the command: geom_smooth(size=10) or something along those lines
U088QGJBE0L,I had trouble visualizing this as well. Sometimes geom_smooth doesn't provide results if you have a categorical variable type (like reps) as one of your aesthetics. Try changing your aesthetic settings to both numerical variables.
U088QGJBE0L,"For AME1, I keep getting an error that says ""attempt to use zero length variable name"" even when coding in a chunk, when assignign a new variable. Is there an easier fix to this rather than putting apostrophes around every variable name? (discussion)"
U088N1B170S,"I had the same issue, I fixed it by making sure that the file I was pulling data from is within the working directory I had set for the .RMD (Files -> More -> ‘Set as working directory’), then it worked only after I reloaded RStudio. I think that second part may be because of a software bug."
U088N1B170S,"If you’re asking how to rename many rows at once, like change ‘O’ to ‘Ollie’, you can use something like “data$Column <- c(rep(n, “Name”), rep(n, “Name”))"
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion) After class, I was curious to further research the conservative energy system associated with our running capabilities. I was wondering if it would be worth it, evolutionarily, to elongate the calcaneus tendon to potentially increase the elastic potential energy stored in the tendon.  This would be able to release more push-off from the ground during running, increasing efficiency. It seemed to insinuate a bell curve though in the maximum efficiency of the energy system itself regarding the tendon, i.e. if the tendon is too short it can't act effectively, and if it's too long it can't act effectively either. I was wondering if we are already maximizing our energy transfer dynamics or if we could potentially make it better"
U088N1B170S,"Not an answer, but if you have watched the Nike documentary about breaking a sub-2 hour marathon, they mention that part of the reason Kenyans are so great at distance running is because of genetic factors like this, and how these factors limit what the ‘fastest possible’ marathon time might be for a human. Definitely worth a watch."
U088QGKHJ20,How does the relationship between metabolic power and physical power in human locomotion change during activities such as sprinting or uphill walking compared to normal walking on a flat surface?
U088FCLC7PG,"After today's lecture, I was really curious about how one may apply this kind of thinking of human locomotion to swimming, as the added aspect of water changes the way in which we move. What biomechanical and physiological factors might contribute to changes in energy expenditure and movement efficiency when someone is kicking their legs in the water? How does this vary across different strokes? (e.g freestyle, butterfly, breaststroke, etc)"
U0887F6V4UX,"I had trouble getting the plots in the plots section after saving. For some reason, after I save file it would not show up on the plots section. But I figured out a way so it shows up on the R IDE. When I knit it, it comes out fine but I was wondering why the graphs and tables wouldn't initially show up on the plots section. Did someone else have this issue? I did a lot of research for this but I could only find a way to make it show on the R IDE."
U0887F6V4UX,"That's a very interesting question. Upon quick research, I found out the freestyle is generally the most efficient and fastest. Efficient in a way that it  goes the longest distance with the same energy output. I'm not sure about how the physiological factors influence this, but I'm guessing it is because it minimizes the water drag. The point where you ""break"" the water as one moves forward is minimized, allowing you to go forward with less effort."
U088FCLP61L,I wondered this too because I have swam for years. I think it depends on the stroke since some strokes take you out of the water more than others. Instead of measuring a stride like running/walking I think the “stride” would either be related to the number of cycles of your arms with one cycle in butterfly equaling two in freestyle. 
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) How do you deal with two overlapping points on a plot in R? This came up in AME1 on replicate 3. Without doing anything to alter the output, one data point will just cover up the other making it appear to not exist."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) The different ways I found for solving this issue are using a jitter (but I do not like the way this looks for a scatter plot), or you can change the shape/size of the points. This can be done by using aes(size=group) or aes(shape=group). You can also pick the shapes and sizes using  scale_size_manual(values=c()) or scale_shape_manual(values=c()). You have to look up which values yield which shapes, but the process is actually not too difficult and makes overlapping points much more visible."
U088FCLP61L,One question I had after class was how a non bipedal animal’s stride differs compared to a bipedal such as a human. Obviously they have more feet touching the ground compared to a human but how would their stride be measured if they were walking or running if they were of an equal mass to an average human. Then to this too how would an uneven number of feet touching the ground when they are moving at faster speeds after the duty factor and the Freud number
U0887F68Q8P,"This is a very thoughtful question. I am not quite sure whether this is a good answer, but I think quadrupeds generally have smaller stride but higher stride frequency. However, the quadruped's duty factor could also depend on how many percent of their limbs are on the ground, if under 50%. it can be classified as walking, if more than 50%, it can be classified as running, in this way we may can regard the uneven number of limbs, or when we encounter the uneven number problem, we can create a new semi-structure model for that situation according to the acceleration and angle."
U0887F33HTR,"I agree with the idea of a bell curve of efficiency; if the achilles tendon were too short or too long there could be some disadvantages. First, if it was too short, there would be little capacity to actually store elastic potential energy (which would be inefficient), and running would primarily rely on muscular power from the calf muscles. However, if the tendon were too long, I think it would start to lose stiffness. It would essentially become looser and more compliant, unable to fully stretch and store energy. I think we are primarily already maximizing our energy transfer dynamics, as they have been fine-tuned by evolution (just making the tendon longer would not really help us). I think factors that probably have more impact are the length of our legs and muscle strength (including muscle fiber type and oxygen efficiency) allowing us to add more energy into the system and yield greater stride lengths."
U089ARFS08G,"In class today, we discussed how non-shod running allows for the least amount of energy to be used and shod running would use more energy. In addition, there is a lower duty factor for non-shod running since the tendons can elongate, therefore, releasing energy "
U088N1D569Y,"That’s an interesting point, there was a study I looked at by García-Arrabé, et. al., 2024 that says that foot muscle thickness and ankle flexion/range of motion is decreased in shod runners (article link: "
U0890MX5R33,You can edit the size I directly
U0890MX5R33,"So it would be ....+geom_smooth(method = ""lm"" , size = 5) for example"
U088FCLC7PG,"This is a really interesting question, one that I too had after Tuesday’s lecture. I would assume that quadrupeds would have a significantly different stride than bipedal animals, with unique stride lengths, and frequencies. When an uneven amount of feet are touching the ground, it can be assumed that the animal is moving faster, perhaps galloping. The duty factor would decrease with speed, as a lesser portion of the stride would be spent in contact with the ground. The Froude number would also likely increase, as more force is being generated than the theoretical amount. I am not quite sure if my answer is correct but I hope it at least gives you something to work upon. Great question!"
U0887F6V4UX,"During the revision, I realized that I did not use proper heading for objectives and interpretations section. I revised this by adding the appropriate title for each section, and starting a new chunk so it can come up in a nice box when knit. I had trouble finding out why it the interpretations section was in a gray box, but it was because I did not start a new chunk using ` ` `."
U0887F6V4UX,"Before the fire drill last week, we were discussing about how animals above 20kg can stand, with their bones withstanding the stress. After looking at the last slide, scaling in EMA (the seesaw looking figure) I was wondering if this is because bigger animals are more upright? If an animal is more upright, that means less horizontal stress the bone goes through. For example, breaking a long pasta noodle is harder if it is completely upright, but easier if it is in an angle to the surface. This was my guess, there may be much more to it."
U0887F68Q8P,"Does anyone know how to fix errors in R when coding to adjust the angle of amplified pelvic positions? I keep encountering error messages, and I'm not sure how to resolve them. I tried to use as.numeric() but failed."
U088FCLP61L,"I believe my group was getting to this point too before the fire alarm went off. We noticed that the angle the bones and legs form was reduced as the mass of the animal increased to allow force to pass more in line with the bones, as you said. We also were discussing how this upright position might sacrifice increased mobility as seen when comparing animals such as cats to elephants. I think the more vertical position of the bones always for the increased mass but prevents the animal from performing quick or jumping motions. In my mind "
U088N1B170S,"(Discussion) We discussed the different types of levers in class, and I was interested  by the fact that  not every flexer or extensor was the same type of lever, especially the quadriceps and triceps. What do you think is the advantage or reason we have different types of levers in joints that are so anatomically similar?"
U088FCMFG9L,"(Discussion) In class today, we talked about the differences between arthropod joints and vertebrate joints, and how arthropods have their muscles inside of an exoskeleton which serves as a point of insertion. What evolutionary forces led to arthropods having such a contrasting joint-muscle system to vertebrates?"
U088N1DJDS6,"In general, we need levers of differing variations to account for the body's need to balance forces, utilize a range of motion and speed, and be energy efficient for various activities. These joints are all anatomically similar, I believe, because of shared evolutionary origin and the mechanistic principles that govern movement in the body. I mean, evolution tends to favor efficient solutions, and having our joints being fairly anatomically similar means for us as vertebrates, it has been effective overall, and they haven't been deemed as sufficient for our anatomy. Also, by starting with a similar anatomical foundation, the body can adapt joints to different functions without completely redesigning them, saving energy and developmental complexity."
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion) We talked about in class how not all levers are created equal and how some are more efficient in terms of force production, speed, and energy expenditure. I was curious about the differences between the design principles of our biological lever systems compared to those of engineered mechanical systems. For instance, I was looking up which lever system was more prevalent in the human body and it said that third-class levers were the most abundant, but second-class levers were mechanically more efficient at producing force. Why do we, as vertebrates, choose to generally prioritize speed over strength within our joint lever system."
U088N1B170S,"I would guess that at some point, arthropods found it to be advantageous to have a protective outer layer, and that was likely the driving factor rather than biomechanics. My other guess is that since they have an open cardiovascular system, it might be advantageous to have everything ‘homogenous’ inside their exoskeletons"
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) The way it makes sense to me is that third class levers allow for greater speed and larger ranges of motion with relatively small muscle contraction. For example a small contraction of the bicep can allow a large movement at the hand. Our musculoskeletal system is highly versatile in which case speed and dexterity are likely more important than overall force production. Additionally, the third class levers of the body are likely more capable of producing rapid and fluid movements, which was probably more advantageous for early humans who were regularly involved in hunting, escaping predators/danger, or climbing."
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) In class, we talked about the jaw as a lever, shifting between a 2nd-class lever (when chewing with molars for more force) and a 3rd-class lever (when biting with incisors for precision). This adaptability allows for both strength and control, making the jaw highly efficient for processing different foods. I feel like a similar dynamic lever system exists in the arm, where the forearm can function as a 2nd-class lever when lifting a heavy object close to the body and as a 3rd-class lever during regular bicep curls. What advantages might these shifting lever systems provide in daily movements?"
U0887F33HTR,"I agree, the lever system of the arm can also be incredibly dynamic. When holding the mass further from the elbow joint, like in the hands during a bicep curl, the weight can be moved precisely, quickly, and over a large range of motion (3rd-class lever with better gear ratio). This is useful in quickly picking up any object, or maybe trying to quickly flip an object over with the hands. On the other hand, when trying to hold a heavy object like a bag or suitcase close to the body/elbow, the forearm is acting more like a 2nd-class lever. There is little control or range of motion here, but it allows us to lift much heavier weights for longer periods of time due to the reduced muscle effort (because you have more mechanical advantage)."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) When thinking about the eccentric part of a muscle movement (like curling a weight and trying to prevent it from coming back down), I am not really sure what is occurring between the myosin filament head and actin. I understand that tension remains more stable in regard to shortening velocity due to elastic potential energy building up, but how are the myosin and actin filaments actually sliding past each other? Is the myosin filament head capable of “walking” backwards in a controlled fashion, or are bonds between actin and myosin just physically breaking, causing the muscle to lengthen? Why can we not just isometrically hold a weight indefinitely?"
U088FCLC7PG,"After today’s class, I could not help but think of several injuries to different areas of the body that could affect the lever systems we talked about. For example, in terms of first-class levers, I thought of whiplash. Given that the head and neck function as a first class lever, how does the fulcrum positioning influence the severity of whiplash-related injuries? I also thought of the Achilles tendon as an example of a second class lever injury. If this tendon is ruptured, how would an individual’s ability to push off the ground be affected? How would the body adjust its levers to compensate?"
U0890MX5R33,"(Discussion)For the AME1, in my original code I was missing  mutate(max=as.numeric(max),rep=as.numeric(rep)) - for the linear plot code. I added it for revisions and it helped the plot but I'm not sure exactly what the code does and why it is necessary for the plot to function correctly?"
U089ARFS08G,"After thinking about different types of lever systems, I realized that the lever system can be used to explain the discrepancy of the maximum pelvic tilt angle versus the actual maximum pelvic tilt angle that is achieved. For example, the hip joint can act as a fulcrum while the quadriceps can act as the lever, making it a 3rd class lever system because the muscle force and the load (moving your leg a step forward) is between the fulcrum and you need a larger input for a small output. In addition, range of motion between the hip joint and quadricep muscle can be influenced by joint health (ex: degenerative joint disease  such as osteoarthritis) and the strength of a person (a average person vs a professional athlete)."
U088N1D569Y,"When learning about levers in class I tried to continue to think of other examples throughout the day and about which are most common. I think 3rd class levers can be seen the most in joints, we talked about the elbow joint and jaw but I believe it could also be seen in the knee joint. 3rd class levers are beneficial because they can generate high speed (at the sacrifice of mechanical advantage). This use of 3rd class levers "
U088QGJBE0L,In regards to the mp1 when using mtrackj’s dark centroid function we found the only way to complete the assignment was going through frame by frame. Has anyone found a better way to do this? (Discussion)
U088QGJBE0L,This was a question I had and I agree with Gregory it was likely evolutionary pressures specific to their lifestyle. I also wonder what class of levers we might find within arthropod joints and if a different class predominates due to these pressures. 
U088FCLP61L,One question that I had was regarding the use of  levers and fulcrums in the and wondered how this might differ in a species and how a slight change might give advantage or disadvantages within a species when used for competition over resources and survival. 
U088FCMFG9L,"I think if you were to rupture your Achilles tendon, it would greatly reduce your ability to push off the ground, primarily due to anatomical considerations. Pushing off the ground is primarily driven by the shortening of the soleus and gastrocnemius muscles, which are able to exert force on the foot via the attachment of the Achilles tendon. Depending on the severity, a rupture would greatly decrease your ability to transmit force from the muscle to the tendon insertion."
U088FCLC7PG,"This is a really good question about Tuesday's lecture, one that I also looked into. I started thinking about different species such as lions and cheetahs, as I feel they are a good example of how small changes in levers and fulcrums can impact fitness. Lions have shorter limb segments that can generate more power, whereas cheetahs have longer limbs that optimize speed. In terms of gender, I also believe that it can impact these biomechanical ideas. Males in many species prioritize strength for competition, while females may prioritize speed or endurance. Small anatomical differences such as these can lead to advantages in survival, and greatly demonstrate how evolution is shaped by biomechanics. Great question!"
U088QGJBE0L,On AME1 I'm having trouble with getting an error message when trying to group_by(Species) it is saying species is not found as an object. Does anyone know how to fix this error (discussion).
U088QGJBE0L,This is something I looked into as well. Third class levers are definitely the most common in the human body. The knee is another example of a third class lever as well. I think you are right about muscular density in mammals compensating for levers that sacrifice mechanical advantage for speed (discussion)
U088N1B170S,"make sure you are using the pipe %>% function properly, otherwise you need to specify ‘iris$Species’"

U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) In class today, I was very intrigued by our approach to designing a comparative research project to assess the agility of large dinosaurs. The idea of using extant animals as biomechanical analogs to estimate the mobility/agility of an extinct species was particularly fascinating. We discussed several factors that would be incorporated into the comparative research approach, including bone density, mass, cross-sectional area, and safety factors. Additionally, I think adding perspectives of ecological roles, like how the dinosaurs we viewed in class are likely herbivores, could further contribute to how we address the question of agility. For the species of dinosaurs we viewed today (such as supersaurus vivianae), what would be the best extant animal to use in a comparison? We discussed the possibilities of an elephant or a giraffe. Would you use the elephant, giraffe, both, or an entirely different animal in your comparative research project?"
U088N1DJDS6,"When it comes to useful analogs for comparative research on these large dinosaurs, rhinos, and giraffes are generally the most effective and most commonly discussed. However, I was doing some research, and some other similarly effective substitutes can be utilized. Rhinos are good since they are similar quadrupedal mammals to elephants, plus they have a more compact body plan compared to elephants, which might help model certain aspects of these sauropod movements. Also, other large reptiles would be useful since they are closer phylogenetically to dinosaurs, and their limb structure, gait, and sprawling position could provide insight into the evolutionary transition from sprawling to erect positions in dinosaurs."
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion) I was also intrigued by the idea of this comparative research idea for these extant species, especially dinosaurs, but I wanted to potentially focus on the aquatic portion of these ideas. Some researchers theorize sauropods may have spent time in the water to support their massive bodies, and I was curious about the biomechanical significance that has on their distribution of force over area. Like would the buoyancy of water allow enough reduction of weight felt and alleviate stress on their limbs and joints? How would this affect their overall gait, would it allow for increased stride length and a much more energy-efficient walking system? How would their necks and tails be utilized in this fashion, could they use them as stabilizers within the water or even as a motor to aid in faster aquatic traversal?"
U088N1B170S,"(Discussion) Not a question but more of a talking point: This week’s AME and MP have taught us to create complex functions on R that can be solved by entering a few variables and reused infinitely. Having used R in Biostats and now this course, I wish that more classes at BC integrated this system of teaching rather than doing ‘old fashion’ plug and chug math that becomes repetitive busywork. Feel free to agree/disagree"
U0887F68Q8P,"Not many careers depend on R nowadays, but it is commonly taught in college as the language used for interdisciplinary courses. I kinda agree with your point on integrating this system of teaching into more courses, but I also feel like there's a need to do the old-fashioned or repetitive busy work for CS majors as the very basic knowledge."
U0887F68Q8P,"Discussion Question:
Today’s lecture on resilience, toughness, and elasticity in muscles and bones reminded me of an intern’s work on artificial knee replacements. When designing replacement organs or implants, what key material properties should be prioritized, and what materials best replicate the mechanical functions of natural tissues?"
U088FCMFG9L,"Discussion: When discussing in groups today, our group noticed how the large terrestrial dinosaurs like the Supersaurus had very short legs compared to their overall stature. How does this especially short leg length influence the distribution of forces throughout the skeleton of the dinosaur?"
U088FCMFG9L,"Hi Matthew, I think overall the buoyant force exerted by the water on the sauropod's body would directly counteract the gravitational force and help reduce the magnitude of force being exerted on the creature's skeleton. However, as a trade-off, I think the increased viscosity of water compared to air would introduce an additional drag force that may make walking in water less energy efficient than on land."
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion: Our lecture today had me wondering if the ration of the bones is important in agility or not. For example, I would assume a longer tibia compared to the femur would allow the creature to stride faster. I also wonder if animals with long horizontal skeletal structures gain an advantage from it other than being able to reach tall trees."
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion Answer: Upon quick research, I learned that plastic is widely used for bone replacements. It says this is because it is not only durable, but also light and easy to make. Other examples are titanium and cobalt chromium. I'm not sure which materials are used for organ replacements though."
U0887F33HTR,"Discussion answer: I mostly looked into joints, and there is the obvious, like materials must be wear-resistant to last long and they must be inert/unreactive in order to prevent any allergic reactions with the recipient. In addition to having a relatively low mass/density, this is why titanium is very often used in joint replacements. Joint replacements often use polyethylene as well, which adds some elasticity shock absorbing capability, mimicking joint cartilage. Replacement joints must also have high tensile and compressive strength, so certain alloys of titanium are produced in order to maximize this while still keeping weight relatively low. Ceramics have all of these properties as well and are being researched, but they are still not used because they are somewhat brittle (they need to become more fracture resistant). The key though from what I have seen is that very well researched alloys and combinations of particularly arranged materials are necessary to mimic the properties of our joints."
U0887F33HTR,Discussion: I was curious if there are any materials in the body that are intentionally optimized to have 
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) I think one example of what you are describing could be cartilage in the joints. Cartilage in the joints does not break easily, but it does return less energy. Cartilage in the joints is optimized to "
U088FCLC7PG,"Discussion: After today's lecture, I kept thinking about the discussion I had in my small group about the comparative model. It got me thinking about the influence of bone shape on locomotion and agility. I specifically thought about the comparison between an animal like an elephant, which has column-like limb bones, and animals with slender and elongated legs. How does the role of cross-sectional shape affect an animal's bone resilience? How might these cross sections affect different modes of movement?"
U0890MX5R33,Discussion: I also think that ligaments are also made to break more easily because if a ligament is too strong it can cause more severe injury under strain. EX - An unbreakable ligament in your foot would cause you to break your leg instead of sprain your ankle
U088FCLP61L,One question I had was regarding the evolutionary decision to take size over agility and vice versa. In class we were looking at the large dinosaurs and in my small group we spoke about how these creatures gave up their ability to move quickly to support their massive weights. I was curious what is the driving source behind these decisions to get big and slow or lighter and more agile. Also I was curious if there exists an extant example that demonstrates the reverse with a large agile creature or a light weight slow creature. How would these vertebrates differ in their environments with these adaptions
U089ARFS08G,"One question I have is if bone strength in large animals and their toughness are a potential trade off in the context of biomechanics. While it may have a lot of benefits, I do think there are some significant trade offs involved."
U088N1D569Y,(Discussion) Building off the discussions of others - especially Metthew’s mention of aquatic species- and the mention of future potentials for robots to model physiology I did some research and found a robot that models frogs and their transition from tadpoles to adults: 
U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi All,"
U06DFEQBJRF,Only a half the class filled out the peer contribution form for MP1. This is a required part of each MP!  Please do so at you earliest! Thanks!
U0887F68Q8P,"Great question! I feel like the evolutionary result is definitely because these animals are under various pressures from different environments. For animals evolve larger and larger they might want to save their energy as larger body sizes have lower metabolite rates. But there are also some large agile creatures like kangaroos, or light weight slow creatures like turtles."
U06DFEQBJRF,Calendar invite for final party:
U088N1D569Y,(Discussion) I found it interesting in class today learning about how 
U088N1B170S,"(Discussion) in class we referenced several examples of how the second moment of area affects how much load/stress a material can resist before breaking, and the example prof. used was a carpenter pencil. I was curious what real life examples we have of this in the body and what evolutionary forces allowed for this? I thought of the clavicle, which needs to provide a lot of support across one axis ad doesnt need to supply as much support across the other axis. This is also why most collarbone breaks and fractures happen with an upwards/downwards force and not a forward/backward force"
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) Our discussion of ecology's role in the probability of a fracture/failure of a bone was very interesting to me, especially around the concept of how humans live relatively ""safe"" lives. Compared to other species, we have built  environments that minimize our exposure to high-force impacts, predators, and extreme physical demands. However, in terms of our built environment that makes our life ""safe"", I started to consider how this has introduced some evolutionary mismatches for us as humans in our modern lifestyles. Through increasingly sedentary lifestyles and poor nutrition in our ""safe"" built environments, we have created new risk factors for bone health shown in conditions such as osteoporosis. Looking forward, how might changes in physical activity patterns or diet over time impact the evolution of human bone structure and strength?"
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) I think another very important example of this in terms of evolutionary background of humans is the femur. The femur has a mostly circular shaft and is supporting a load in the vertical axis. The femur carries most of the body's weight, and in evolutionary terms has been crucial in the support of bipedal locomotion while withstanding compressive forces from running, walking, etc."
U088N1B170S,"I like this prompt because it covers something important that Kenaley actually briefly addresses in his physiology course. preventing a child from moving around, jumping, climbing, etc. results in bone formation that can cause health problems later in life. I believe that this is the reason why many people in our generation are skeptical of how toddlers are given iPads before they can even walk (not to mention the psychological impacts)… only time will tell what the results may be."
U088FCMFG9L,"(Discussion) In class today, I found the differences between Euler buckling and local buckling that we talked about interesting. These two differing models had me thinking about how these concepts could be applied to a biological system, such as a long bone like the humerus or femur. It left me wondering: what would a buckling model look like for a vertebrate long bone? Would it be closer to a Euler buckling or local buckling model? Vertebrate longbone is trabeculated (pored) and also contains a marrow cavity, which I believe puts it somewhere in between the two models (not totally solid but also not totally hollow), but to what extent I am not sure."
U088N1DJDS6,"Reading over both responses reminded me of the people in Wall-E and their distorted lifestyles on the cruise spaceship. They got so lazy and sedentary that they ended up living their lives on lazy boys while staring mindlessly at a holographic screen as if they had no perception of anything happening around them. Considering their stature in the movie you'd expect them to barely support any load at all because of the stress that these bones are used to are basically none on these multifaceted chairs. And to support all that excess weight they put on, if they were to stand after 30 years of doing almost nothing those bones would exceed their max stress almost instantaneously and break their femurs. When it comes to these iPad kids too, there has been a surge in ADHD diagnoses which have links to the overuse of electronics and the everchanging modes of entertainment that rot kids brains."
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion) After we spoke about second moment of area in terms of likelihood of fracture, I was wondering if there was any potential ways we can prevent fractures such as hip fractures for example in elderly people by synthetically changing the second moment of area. As we are becoming more and more aware of what issues bones can cause at later stages of life, I was wondering if we could increase the overall surface area of these at risk portions of bone such as the neck of the femur to prevent their potential/eventual failure down the line? I recognize I'm not taking into considering the overall physiology of an individual when making these claims but even a couple centimeters of additional space around the neck adding to the radius of the bone allows the second moment of area to increase that much more to the 4th power, allowing for greater stress before failure. Also I'm not sure what material would be most suitable because usually they put metal rods and plates and "
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Reply) I think it depends on the bone and what portion of the bone is being stressed, so I think long bones would have to be modeled by a hybrid of both Euler and local buckling. In regions with more trabecular/spongy bone than compact bone, I think the local buckling model would be more accurate (especially along sections of the bone with the medullary cavity, this is essentially a hollow cylinder). But cortical/compact bone along the shaft would probably be better modeled by Euler buckling. I think your question really demonstrates the broader idea of how these models are made for ideal scenarios, but in real world cases it is much more complicated, so a combination of models is required and the math is very messy."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) I was curious to learn about the different safety factors present in different animals and why this is the case. I get that the lifestyle/actions of an animal will result in a greater safety factor for simple movements like walking (because they require a greater breaking stress to tolerate the greater experienced stresses of more extreme things like jumping/falling), but why do some animals like elephants get so close to a safety factor of 1? I would imagine it is just out of necessity because of their massive size, but are there no ways to raise this safety factor? On the other hand, why do some animals have such high safety factors, especially if they will never get remotely close to an experienced stress that could result in a break? Is this something that is selected for, or as long as the safety factor is above 1 for all forms of locomotion it does not really matter if it is any higher?"
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion: As we learned about safety factors in lecture today, situational factors was really interesting. Looking at different animals and how they are more prone to breaking a bone in their lifetime due to how they operate and fight for survival was necessary in regards to determining why their SF was much higher than humans. I wonder if back when we were hunter-gatherers we were more prone to breaking a bone? I have never broken a bone in my life and whenever I think of a situation where someone I know had broken a bone is accidental, something that happens outside of their 'normal' lives."
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion Question: Regarding the ""I"" (second moment of area), I wonder which shape is theoretically the most stable and deals with stress ideally? And does our evolutionary bone structures reflect that? I can think of some examples like the molars being more flat than the canines as they serve different purposes. Molars would be better than canines to deal with more stress as it can break harder food. What are some other examples of how ""I"" is applied in human bodies?"
U0887F68Q8P,"Discussion Question: Under the concept of the second moment of area, for the shape of a rectangular, does the 'w' and 'h' values change when it rotates every 90 degrees, or the length of them is always fixed and unchanged even though the angle changes?"
U0887F68Q8P,"Theoretically, I feel the most stable shape of the second moment of area is the hollow cylinder, as it evenly distributes its weight throughout and does not change its 'I' through rotation. I feel like our bone structure generally follows that pattern of this hollow shape, even it is not perfectly fully hollow, it is partially holly to balance the irregular shape of bones."
U088FCLC7PG,"Discussion: In some of the longer bones =, such as the femur and the tibia, the second moment of area is greater around certain axes. This therefore allows for efficient resistance against bending forces. How can this same principle be applied to differences in bone structure between species with different locomotion styles? For example, how may this concept compare between humans and quadrupedal mammals?"
U089ARDGJFJ,"I think that I am misunderstanding something  but are the o values and Lmuscle values the same? Based on the diagram associated with the Law of Cosines and the theoretical arm diagram, it seems like they are the same measurement, but if that is the case, when the tibble is created based on the model, the theta values come out the same as the flexion angle"
U088FCLP61L,One question that I had after 
U088QGJBE0L,After todays class my question was 
U088QGJBE0L,One would assume based on the slide today on buckling that a thicker (less hollow) tube would be less prone to bending. However 
U0890MX5R33,In Class we talked about how bones usually break at the point of lowest second moment area. Is there an advantage to this - do these areas typically heal faster?
U088FCMFG9L,"I think that to some degree bones have evolved to account for optimal fracture prevention. For example, femurs usually withstand force as we stand, and are longer along this axis of standing and therefore have a higher resistance to deformation. However, bones also have other evolutionary pressures such as needing to be lightweight to enable energy-efficient movement. Additionally, bones have to accomodate muscle insertions, which would make longer bones more optimal than those that might be better for fracture prevention from side-on impacts."

U088N1B170S,do we have the AME password?
U0887F33HTR,^
U088FCLP61L,I think this all depends on the expected weight and force that a species plans to deal with and where that force is going to be dissipated. Comparing humans to quadrupedals may be difficult because of how our weight is distributed across our legs and other supporting bones. 
U088FCLC7PG,"This is a great question! I believe that bone adaptation would generally follow the principle of maximizing resistance to bending. Bones may have to remodel somewhat to account for different loads, balancing strength with weight. Certain fractures with a high frequency persist because of repetitive loading, which can cause microdamage that may accumulate faster than it is able to repair. Also, aging and osteoporosis reduce bone strength over time, increasing the risk of fracture. Our bones still are not able to handle the stress of modern day  activities, such as high impact sports. While bones are able to adapt to stress, they are unable to eliminate all risks of fracture."

U088N1B170S,"(Discussion) Now that MP2 is over, how did everyone’s observed results compare to their calculated? Everyone in my group lifted more than predicted, but I am curious if this is a common trend amongst groups or common error amongst our group.
"
U088FCLP61L,In our group the predicted was about the same as the actual. One person was found to be able to lift roughly 20 lbs (
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Response) I also noticed this trend. My observed values followed the same pattern as the predicted, but my partner and I lifted ~7.5 pounds more than we predicted for each value. I think this may be due to the fact that our model was only accounting for the biceps muscle, but not the other muscles that assist in elbow flexion like the brachialis and brachioradialis. There may have also been some smaller factors like underestimating muscle mass with the playdoh, but I think the lack of incorporation of other synergistic muscles was the main issue with the model."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) How do geckos stick to surfaces using van der Waal's forces if these forces are so weak? Is there any kind of surface that prevents these interactions from occurring, and what about a gecko's environment makes this the best mechanism for them to climb?"
U088N1D569Y,"Our results were similar to what the above comments observed ^. Most of our team lifted similar amounts, however the results were not 100% consistent, with some angles producing actual results that were above, and others below, predicted. We thought that one reason for this was other synergistic muscles being recruited to assist the biceps brachii (when actual > predicted). We thought our golgi tendon reflex "
U088N1DJDS6,"Geckos stick to surfaces using van der Waal's forces but in a way that they evolved a specialized adaptation that amplifies the van der Waal effects. I read that their feet are covered in millions of microscopic hair-like structures called setae, and these structures drastically increase the surface area while in contact with another surface, allowing geckos to generate enough adhesion to support their body weight. This mechanism is reversible and energy-efficient since geckos can attach and detach their feet rapidly by changing the angle of contact. Certain surfaces can disrupt the adhesion, such as porous & rough surfaces, wet or slippery surfaces, and extremely smooth low-energy surfaces.  This mechanism is great for geckos because usually they have to navigate a variety of surfaces in the jungle, making a versatile, energy-efficient climbing method crucial for survival."
U0887F68Q8P,"(Discussion) I just went over the slide of today uploaded. Does the effectiveness of suction depend on environmental factors? Such as temperature, humidity?"
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) I would assume that the effectiveness of suction does depend on environmental factors. Considering temperature, a change in temperature will cause a change in air density which can affect the pressure needed for efficient suction. Additionally, with high humidity there may condensation within the suction cup which may reduce friction or cause slipping."
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) Looking at the picture of the octopus and its suction cups, and considering Margaret's question above, I began to wonder how the the effectiveness of suction would be different underwater versus in air. Wouldn't the environment of water lead to a lack of friction and potential slippage, making the suction cups of the octopus ultimately ineffective? How does the octopus maintain the effectiveness of its suction cups in a marine environment?"
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion: Looking at different mechanisms of adhesion, molecular mechanism was the most interesting to me. Using van der waal's forces equation to figure out the radius and distance was a fascinating point. What are some real life examples of this?"
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion: I wonder if claws as an adhesion mechanism is similar to how straps work for working out. Since most organism's claws kind of act like an additional lever system, would it be similar to humans using straps? Because they have longer (ratio-wise), it would also be easier for these organisms to hang onto stuff. I believe humans having shorter fingers (again, ratio-wise) and having multiple joints within the fingers itself puts us at a disadvantage in climbing or hanging on."
U0890MX5R33,I was curious about the evolutionary aspect of suction limbs/appendages - why are the advantages and why have some organisms evolved to have them while others haven't?
U088FCLC7PG,"Discussion: After reading through today's slides, I was really curious about Stefan adhesion. Stefan adhesion occurs when fluid is trapped in between two surfaces, and is often seen in amphibians and insects. How might this phenomenon be affected by environmental conditions such as humidity or temperature? How might the adhesive qualities of a tree frog differ from those of a bullfrog?"
U088N1DJDS6,"Discussion: Claws enhance grip through frictional adhesion, mechanical interlocking, and surface interactions. The sharpness, curvature, and material composition of claws (mainly keratin) influence how animals maintain contact with different surfaces. One key mechanical principle at play is the cantilever beam effect, where the claw is anchored at one end within the toe or paw while the free end engages with a surface, distributing forces effectively. This biomechanical advantage allows animals to resist bending forces and maintain stability while gripping or supporting their body weight. With this in mind, how do variations in claw shape, material properties, and adhesion mechanisms across different species influence their ability to climb, dig, or capture prey? Furthermore, how might studying these adaptations inspire biomimetic applications, such as the design of robotic gripping systems or advanced prosthetic limbs?"
U088QGJBE0L,"Discussion: I was curious about this as well, I wonder if some animals can sense changes in conditions such as humidity or temperature and adjust accordingly. Like some animals can sense changes in barometric pressure before a storm and move to shelter."
U088QGJBE0L,discussion: Mechanisms discussed in the slides from today of adhesion all serve relatively the same purpose however some appendages appear more alike than others. For example suction and capillary adhesion have more similar morphologies to one another than a claw. I wonder which if any of these methods of adhesion are examples of convergent evolution and which are examples of divergent evolution?
U088FCLP61L,"I was curious that with all of these for a of adhesions, are there any species that may utilize more that one type. The claws are mainly noticed in terrestrial animals while suction seems to be in aquatic and capillary adhesions seems to be in amphibious species. Compared to Stefan Adhesions, the others seem to allow for more mobility but I wonder if there are examples of vertebrates possessing multiple "
U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi All, please use this link to sign up for bending experiments. "
U088N1D569Y,^ do we need to do the bending experiment together w/ our group or can we gather data separately?
U06DFEQBJRF,"With the group, yes."
U088FCMFG9L,"(Discussion) In class today, we talked about how there are a disproportionate amount of small organisms that use a cantilever system as opposed to larger ones due to scaling issues. The sloth seems to be one of the only ""larger"" creatures to use this system, and I was wondering if there were any special mechanisms by which the sloth is able to overcome its scaling disadvantage when using the cantilever system."
U088FCMFG9L,"I feel like the mechanisms of suction and Stefan adhesion are a good example of convergent evolution, as they represent different organisms obtaining structures similar in function but different in structure. Both the octapus and limpet use their suction cups and mucous secretions for adhesion and likely evolved these similar yet different appendages as a response to their environment"
U0887F68Q8P,"This is a really good observation. Sloths like larger animals reduce the muscle energy spent, they use their claws to clock on the tree trunk to reduce their muscle contraction force. I also think the long hooks on the claw are beneficial to their resistance"
U088FCLC7PG,"There are definitely some species that use multiple adhesion types, and this is especially dependent on their environment and their needs. For example, frogs use multiple types of adhesion to accomplish different tasks. They use capillary adhesion for clinging to wet surfaces and toe pad friction in order to climb. Another example of this phenomenon is a gecko who may use van der waals adhesion and claws in order to exist in rough terrain."
U089ARDGJFJ,discussion - would the forces used by geckos when walking on or up a very smooth or wet surface be considered van der waals forces?
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) Today in class we discussed how blood is a shear-thinning, non-Newtonian fluid, meaning its viscosity decreases as shear rate increases. How does this property affect circulation in different parts of the body, such as capillaries versus major arteries, and what are the implications for diseases like hypertension or anemia?"""
U088N1B170S,"I thought this was a very interesting and advantageous evolutionary adaptation - it allows blood to flow effectively and at an appropriate speed/viscosity through both capillaries and large veins, two different areas that would have dramatically different BP’s."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) We talked about the functional significance of shear-thinning fluid in the body, like blood, but I was curious if there are any shear-thickening fluids in the human body? If so, where is it found, and why is this property beneficial for the body for that particular fluid?"
U088N1D569Y,"I also wondered about the different viscosities in arteries (higher shearing rate) vs veins. I found an article that talked more about the phenomenon we mentioned in class of higher viscosity increasing risk of blood clots. The paper looked at hyperviscosity syndrome, usually caused by Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and the increase in serum proteins associated with it. It found that hyperviscosity increases prevalence of vascular ischaemia-inducing diseases. (Study: "
U088N1B170S,"(Discussion) At the end of class we addressed why flower nectar is a certain % sugar, which is around 20%. If we selectively bred flowers to have a significantly higher sugar %, what do you think the adaptations of local pollinators, specifically butterfly species, would be? Would we see an increase in non-insect pollinators? are there any real world examples of this?"
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Reply) The higher sugar content would also increase viscosity, so I think the butterflies would need to adapt to this with some change in their proboscises—perhaps their diameter would need to increase or evolve some stronger mouth parts? I think there would be an increase in non-insect pollinators like hummingbirds; hummingbirds actually prefer nectar with a higher sugar content, so maybe these flowers with high sugar content will just be increasingly visited by hummingbirds, while flowers with lower sugar content might still be pollinated by butterflies. Certain plants like Hummingbird Sage actually have already evolved to have higher sugar content in their nectar to attract hummingbirds, but it is not radically different from the 20% in other plants—it is about 30%."
U088FCMFG9L,"(Discussion) Today in class, we talked about the tradeoff between nectar viscosity and sugar concentration from the perspective of pollinators, and how the energy demands of higher viscosity fluids on pollinators lead to a 20% sugar concentration being the optimal figure. My question is how would the plant's own energy needs also factor into this situation? Ideally, the plants would want to give up as little sugar in their nectar as possible to retain the energy for themselves, so how did 20% end up as the equilibrium point when also factoring this element in?"
U088FCLC7PG,"Discussion: Today in class when we discussed the uptake of nectar by butterflies, I couldn't help but think of blood-feeding insects like mosquitoes. How do you think the feeding mechanisms/muscle contractions vary between butterflies and mosquitoes, where one relies on a much more viscous fluid for nutrients? Are mosquitoes able to create a pressure gradient with a greater degree of magnitude?"
U088N1DJDS6,"I don't know if there are naturally occurring shear-thickening fluids in the human body, but synovial fluid can act as one under certain conditions. Under sudden, high-impact loads, synovial fluid can temporarily increase viscosity. This response helps absorb shock and protect cartilage from excess strain. There could be other instances where local concentrations of molecules create sheer-thickening effects under specific conditions but this really is the only one I've seen documented."
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion): After doing some research about synovial fluids and how they can change between sheer-thinning and sheer-thickening fluids, I was curious about how the viscosity of synovial fluid in joints change in response to different physical activities, such as running versus sitting? What are the potential consequences of these changes for joint health, and how might conditions like arthritis alter this balance?"
U088QGKHJ20,"While blood is a more viscous fluid than the nectar, mosquitos actually have a very interesting capability of injecting vasodilatory and anticoagulant (anti-clotting) compounds through their saliva that can reduce clotting and increase blood flow as they feed on the host organism. Additionally, the blood in the host organism (unlike the nectar in a flower) is also pressurized, so the mosquito is likely relying on a negative pressure gradient which will help/encourage the blood to flow out of the host while feeding."
U0887F68Q8P,"Energy production is involved in nectar production, therefore the plants need to restore some energy for their growth and survival. However, if the energy is too little, it is not enough to compete with other plants and attract pollinators. Another factor to consider might be that 20% will probably be the equilibrium point for pollinators to stay at a few flowers instead of one for cross-pollination. If the concentration is too high or low, it might cause it to quickly leave the flower or stay too long at one."
U089ARFS08G,"In today's lecture, we started discussing fluid dynamics, specifically, the relationship between how viscosity and shear stress affect the flow of fluids.

One interesting example of fluid mechanics, that was also mentioned in class, is blood exhibiting behavior of Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids. This is because the method of transportation of blood can be from capillaries, veins, and arteries. Capillaries have low shear rates meaning that viscosity is increasing and it behaves as an ideal fluid. Whereas in arteries, where there is less viscosity, there are high shear rates that have the behavior of Non-Newtonian fluids. Essentially, the viscosity of the blood is not constant and linear to the rate of shear stress when moving through arteries.

However, it was interesting to learn that not all fluids will behave the same when passing through a small “channel” because of the type and amount of solutes. This concept is shown through the example mentioned in class explaining why plants produce dilute nectars. Nectars are consumed by pollinators with small parts. And the mouth parts of the proboscis in the example is very small. Therefore, the flow rate is ideal when there is a 20% concentration of sugar in the nectar. Essentially, nectar at that concentration flowing through the mouth of the proboscis has a huge shearing effect differing significantly to the behavior of blood flowing in the capillaries with a low shearing effect.

Overall, the examples in class explained the relationship of viscosity and shear stress while emphasizing that you cannot make the same assumptions of the behaviors of different fluids."
U088QGJBE0L,Todays discussion on how solute concentration made me think about common blood thinners and their uses to decrease blood viscosity. I wonder if all blood thinners act on solute concentration or if some are vasodilators that decrease sheer rate? 
U0887F6V4UX,Discussion: I realize how an increase in temperature results in a decrease in viscosity. This is probably due to the atoms gaining more energy from heat to move around more freely. What are some real-life examples of putting this characteristic of a fluid to use?
U088QGJBE0L,This is a good question. I believe that pollinators would simply avoid the species of flower altogether and that in the long run the flower would die out due to a lack of its seeds being spread due to pollinators. 
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion; Upon quick research, I learned that the decrease of sheer rate by increasing the blood vessel diameter. It seems like most vasodilators work by decrease of sheer rates with the expansion of cell walls. However, this is just an indirect affect of vasodilators, they are not primarily designed to necessarily decrease shear rate."
U088FCLP61L,Species that consume the nectar would need to be able to put in more energy into extracting the nectar which could be seen in using less energy in other aspects of their life to prioritize the amount of energy they need to get the nectar. We might see species develop larger appendages that are able stronger to apply more force and surface area in collecting the nectar. Species may also move slower to store energy better because although they get more energy from the higher sugar content they must put a lot sucking the viscous liquids. 
U088FCLP61L,"One question that I had was the evolutionary relationship between butterflies anatomy and the flowers they get nectar from. To maximize the about of sugar they are getting from the flower’s nectar, the butterflies would need to maximize the diameter of their proboscis, but has the viscosity affected how long their proboscis has to be? Would a shorter length allow for more because the nectar has to travel a shorter distance or would it be ineffective because it "
U088FCMFG9L,"After doing some quick research, I found a few examples of this characteristic of fluids in the real world. One example is when you are cooking with oil on a frying pan, and as the pan is heated, the oil becomes less viscous. This makes it easier to spread the oil around and lubricate the entire pan surface. Another example of this is motor oil, which is able to effectively lubricate engines (which run at high temperatures) due to a decreased viscosity."
U06DFEQBJRF,Hey all
U088N1B170S,"(Discussion) In class we discussed how a lack of need for streamlining allows bacterium to take on shapes that cannot be seen in other animals on larger scales. On the opposite end of this scale, how does the need for streamlining impact evolution? would you say this is a evolutionary pressure that encourages convergent evolution? what examples of this come to mind?"
U088FCMFG9L,"(Discussion) In class today, we looked at a range of different Reynold's numbers for different phenomena on Earth, such as a blue whale swimming. My question is: does the varying material of an organism's surface (such as having scales versus traditional skin) impact whether the resulting posterior flow is more turbulent or laminar?"
U088N1DJDS6,"Streamlining evolution is important, especially for larger organisms in the water so as to minimize turbulent flow and pressure differences. Viscosity doesn't matter as much for organisms whose size is magnitudes greater than the molecules that make up the water they swim in, and as such need more efficient ways to traverse their aquatic terrain. This strong selective pressure leads to convergent evolution since all these organisms are trying to find the best, most energy-efficient solution to this problem. I saw that dolphins, sharks, and penguins have evolved torpedo-like shapes to efficiently move through water, and although they all have vastly different morphologies, they evolved this strategy as a means to efficiently move through the terrain"
U0887F6V4UX,"That's a great question. Upon a quick research, it seems like more rough organism surfaces like scales as you mentioned create more of a turbulent flow, and a laminar flow for organisms with smoother surfaces. So the short answer is, yes."
U0887F6V4UX,"(Discussion) as we talked about in class today about different materials and organisms' RE, I wondered how this applies to airplanes. It seems like higher altitudes create a more turbulent flow, but this actually helps keep the airplane to maintain lift. One interesting thing I found was that during takeoff, it actually transitions from laminar to turbulent flow. The initially low velocity allows a more stable lift off."
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion) After discussing Bernoulli's Principle more in tandem with Reynolds number, I was curious whether organisms have cool and creative ways of exploiting the principle in nature? Like by somehow utilizing variations in fluid velocity and pressure, they are able to aid in tasks like locomotion and feeding. I'm just curious for some examples that would be cool to read about."
U089ARDGJFJ,(Discussion) I was wondering the same thing as Matthew
U088N1B170S,"I was wondering the same thing during class, I always assumed that plane wings were designed to be aerodynamic, but "
U088QGKHJ20,"(Discussion) Thinking about Reynolds number and streamlining, it’s interesting how different organisms adapt their movement to fluid environments. Bacteria use flagella to move since inertia is negligible, while larger animals like large fish or and birds evolve streamlined shapes to reduce drag. Would this be an example of convergent evolution? What other animals from different lineages have developed similar adaptations to move efficiently?"
U088QGKHJ20,"One cool example I was thinking about is how manta rays use their large, wing-like fins to generate lift in a way similar to aircraft wings/birds, trying to reducing energy expenditure while swimming. Rays have always stood out to me as ""fish"" that have a more unique way of swimming around with large wing-like fins, mainly because we would typically associated ""wings"" with movement through air."
U088FCLP61L,My quest
U088QGJBE0L,In todays lecture we learned that small creatures have to expend more energy to travel through fluids due to the high shear drag and going through a solution of molecules that are large compared to their size. If this is true I wonder are smaller creatures typically limited to smaller habitats as a result of this? Or will smaller creatures expend the energy to travel larger distances at intermittent time intervals like birds do for migration?
U088QGJBE0L,I agree with Jihoon that this definitely contributes to differing types of flow. I would also assume that these flow productions are typically evolutionarily beneficial in some way as to confer some sort of advantage while flying or swimming.
U088FCLC7PG,"In today's class, we discussed how smaller aquatic organisms experience high shear drag, navigating through mediums where molecules are relatively large compared to their body size. How might this selective pressure influence their evolutionary adaptations for locomotion? Do you think there are certain bodily adaptations or locomotion strategies that have helped to mitigate the energetic costs of travel, similar to how birds have evolved to optimize their long-distance migration?"
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Reply) I think I would consider this convergent evolution; thinking of animals like sharks and dolphins, it is amazing how similar the body shapes are of two extremely distantly related animals—a dolphin went from a tetrapod body plan to a streamlined torpedo-like body plan with fins, that is almost identical to that of a shark. Because these two species were under the same environmental pressures with high Reynolds numbers, they evolved similar shapes to reduce drag."
U088N1D569Y,(discussion) In todays lecture we learned that small creatures do not need to be as streamlined shape-wise as flow separation gradient is negligent but large ocean creatures are more streamlined. After learning this I was wondering if this phenomena holds true for flying and land animals. I would guess that flying creatures such as birds would also be more and more streamlined the larger they are as they also must rely on fluid dynamics for flight.
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) In lecture we explored in depth how organisms can reduce drag due to flow separation via varying body shapes, but is it possible to reduce the shear stress or ""skin"" drag? We said this is unavoidable because every fluid will have some viscosity, but I feel like there must be some way to mitigate it—especially for smaller organisms with low Reynolds numbers, this would be a very important problem to overcome."
U0890MX5R33,Discussion: I was zonering if any experiments have been done with humans in higher/lower viscosity liquids and seeing how their swimming patterns change
U0887F68Q8P,"Discussion question: In today's lecture, we discussed Reynolds number (Re) and its relevance to the scale and size of various organisms. One example of an organism operating at a low Reynolds number is sperm. Given the challenges posed by a highly viscous environment at such small scales, what strategies have sperm evolved to enhance their motility and overall viability? Conversely, are there any advantages associated with a low Reynolds number in the context of human reproduction?"
U088FCMFG9L,"I think that evolutionary pressures due to high shear drag certainly influenced microscopic organismal locomotion. In class, we talked about how sperm cells move in a sort of corkscrew motion as opposed to traditional ""swimming"". This unique motion likely allows the cells to move through their medium in a more energy-efficient manner than traditional swimming would offer."
U088FCLC7PG,"I would also assume that flying animals follow this general principle. Larger ocean creatures are more streamlined in order to minimize drag, simplifying their movement through water. In terms of flying creatures, smaller birds/animals will have small Reynolds Numbers, meaning that viscous forces are dominant, making flow separation of air less pronounced. On the other hand, larger birds have high Reynolds Numbers, meaning that flow separation creates highly turbulent wake regions. Large birds, such as albatrosses, eagles, and condors have sleeker and more aerodynamically shaped bodies in order to counteract this pressure drag."
U0887F68Q8P,"It is definitely true that smaller creatures are typically limited to smaller habitats, as their inability to move long distances is due to the higher shear drag and their limited energy to travel long distances. But I feel these smaller creatures can probably facilitate movement by passive force like liquid or air flow."

This left me wondering: over the long run, which wing system (high span vs low span) is more energy efficient? Does having a higher energy cost to beat your wings but beating them less frequently result in more or less energy consumption than the reverse scenario?"
U0887F6V4UX,"(Discussion): In class today, we learned about how we can assume a certain bird's habitat and flight behavior depending on their wingspan and physical build. I wonder if there are exceptions to this? My hypothesis is that if a certain bird has a drastically different flight trait than the other ones in the habitat, it can either be a severe disadvantage or maybe an advantage, being able to move and fly the way others can't."
U0887F6V4UX,"This is a great question, and I was wondering it too. After quick research, I found out that as long as the ""work"" done by both birds are the same, the energy consumption would be equivalent. However, it would differ in more beats or not per distance. Specifically, lower energy cost but higher beat would result in more fatigue on muscle endurance, having to flap the wings faster. On the other hand, higher energy cost but less beat would result in a different kind of fatigue, just on the muscle per beat. Overall, I think they both somehow compensate for the factor which puts them in fatigue, and results in a similar energy consumption ratio wise."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Reply) I think birds with greater aspect ratios (larger spans) of their wings are still significantly more energy efficient. This is because they produce more lift with fewer wingbeats; even though each individual wingbeat is more energy-intensive, the bird is flapping so many fewer times that it really does not matter. In the case of an albatross with the most extreme of spans, they can fly for days without beating their wings a single time—the energy cost of flight is almost negligible. The real tradeoff, as we mentioned, is maneuverability. Massive wings are bulky, make changing direction in flight more difficult, and make ground movement very clumsy and awkward."
U088FCLC7PG,"(Discussion): During class today, I couldn't help but think about flightless birds, like ostriches, in this context. They have wings as they inherited them flying ancestors, but over time, ostriches adapted to living on the ground. Therefore, their wings evolved for other purposes, like running. How do you think the movement, shape, and size of an ostrich's wings influence the lift/drag forces acting on its body while it is running?"
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) We briefly mentioned 'camber' of a wing in class today when talking about how wings with 0 angle of attack can still generate lift, but how exactly does this shape generate lift? What kind of shapes optimize camber to maximize lift, and why would it be useful to generate lift with 0 angle of attack?"
U088N1DJDS6,"The camber shape for most typical wings is positive camber, which refers to the curvature being convex in the upper part so it is curved more while the lower part is relatively flat. I did some research and for wings with a positive camber and a 0 angle of attack, it is possible to still generate lift. The wing's curved upper surface accelerates airflow more than the bottom surface, creating a pressure gradient between the lower and upper parts of the wings. The curved geometry redirects incoming airflow downward, resulting in an opposite upward reaction on the wing.  I saw there were multiple types of camber, but I think high positive camber is probably the best one for maximizing lift. And I think it'd be useful to generate lift with a 0 angle of attack probably because at that angle the induced drag is much less, leading to better energy efficiency; probably would have this angle with general cruising stability though."
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion): We talked mostly about bird lift in lecture today but I was more curious, after discussing the the wright brothers, how planes modification now effect overall aerodynamics and efficiencies. Things such as slats, flaps, and winglets, how to these different wing modifiers affect airflow and lift production, and what trade-offs do they introduce?"
U088N1B170S,"discussion: at the lab I work at, one of our parrots cannot fly because he is older and has preened the tips of his wings too aggressively, leaving the feathers damaged. Based on what we learned today, why would this particularly impact his flight and how would you expect this to affect MP4 results if we were using his and a healthy parrots wings?"
U088N1B170S,"I play flight sims time to time, and this lecture really made a lot of what i was doing out of habit make sense. By extending the flaps the SA of the wing increases, hence introducing more lift at lower speeds, making it optimal for a safe takeoff/landing. unlike the Wright brothers, this allows for improved fuel efficiency throughout the flight, allowing larger payloads to go further distances."
U0887F68Q8P,"Discussion: As we learned in class, birds vary in "
U089ARFS08G,"We know that some birds rely on flapping more than sustained soaring which would lead to differing aspect ratios depending on the bird.

There are numerous evolutionary pressures that favor low aspect ratio wings that are characterized by shorter, broader wings. One evolutionary pressure is how often do they fly and the speed they fly at. A bird who only flies for a short time amount of time would need short, broad wings. This allows them to maneuver in the most efficient manner. For example, a dove has short and broad wings useful to be able to take off quickly to escape from a predator or a danger in their environment.

They cannot evolve endurance flying because of the amount of energy it would take to fly long distances. Birds with low aspect ratio wings generate a lot of drag and they would need more energy to ensure they do not tire out. In addition, there short and broad wings would not allow them to have the ability to soar. Therefore, it would be hard to have birds develop endurance flying."
U0890MX5R33,Discussion: Today we talked about how bird wing shape can help them generate life at a zero angle. I was wondering if this is also true for flying mammals like bats or even gliding mammals like a flying squirrel. Are the differences in shape enough to cause them to have to use an entirely different mechanism of flight?
U088FCLP61L,In class we were talking about lift and observed differences in shape for wings of both birds and some planes. We recognized how the angle and shape of these wings would have different affects on an objects lift. But looking at images I noticed that a lot of wings on planes have larger cross sectional areas near the plane compared to the tips of the wings. I was wondering if this was similar in birds where their wings are larger towards their shoulders and then smaller at the ends of the wings. If so how does this affect drag and lift compared to if the wing was the same thickness throughout
U088QGJBE0L,Discussion: in class we discussed how angle of attack can impact the amount of drag produced by wings in birds. I wonder if there are animals that use extremely elevated or depressed angles of attack to maneuver more quickly/increase their agility while flying? 
U088QGJBE0L,One would assume that if a bird has drastically different flight traits it would either evolve to dominate a particular niche in its environment thus becoming the new dominant species in a region or it would be evolved out due to a lack of fitness in its environment. 
U089ARDGJFJ,"In class we talked about wing shape and how the tails of the wing can specifically cause wind vortexes and induced drag. I would be interested to see how a bird with a damaged wing or missing feathers would fly based on this versus a healthy bird. Similarly, some birds molt their feathers, would they fly differently during molting season? "
U088FCLP61L,This is an interesting thought and in my opinion this can be seen in smaller birds which are light weight and are known for rapid changes in movement. The first that comes to mind would be a swallow. When I watch them they make much more rapid wing movements and lend to flap more in a single flight then other birds. Some quick googling I found they have larger wings for their body size but also are able to rotate their wings with ease. 
U088QGKHJ20,"While birds and bats both generate lift, their wing structures differ significantly. Birds have rigid, feathered wings, whereas bats on the other hand have flexible, membranous wings with many joints. Flying squirrels don’t generate true lift like birds or bats but instead they glide to create air resistance and control their descent. So while the general principles of fluid dynamics apply, their mechanisms of flight are pretty different"
U088QGKHJ20,"Flight is an adaptation seen in many animal groups, from birds and bats to insects and even some fish that glide. I’m curious what are the key evolutionary pressures that led to the development of flight in such different species? Did flight evolve primarily for escaping predators, finding food more efficiently, or something else? Which factors might influence whether an animal evolves true powered flight versus just gliding?"
U088FCMFG9L,I think that a bird with a damaged wing would be more likely to create a wind vortex and turbulence due to the irregular shape of the wing. A wing injury would also likely require the bird to take on a different pattern of wing movement (with a higher energy cost) to compensate for the loss of wing surface area.
U088N1D569Y,Today’s class helped make clear the trade off between soaring efficiency of large birds with big wingspans and 
U0887F68Q8P,I don't think their wings generate significant vertical lift force to assist flying but they could have some horizontal lift force for stabilizing. The wings' shape can either reduce or increase drag force depending on their position.
U088FCMFG9L,"Today in class, we learned how Eels are more efficient in comparison to Tuna in terms of long-distance swimming efficiency. How does the relative composition of slow versus fast twitch muscle fibers in each species contribute to this efficiency along with the kinematic factors that we discussed in class?"
U088N1B170S,"I think that the answer is that they likely have very very small amounts of incredibly specialized muscles that allow them to have that transparent appearance as young. As they age, I think they likely develop more fast twitch muscles, despite what one may think. fish and eels are very strong and explosive when they want to be, which allows them to avoid predators"
U088N1B170S,"BESIDES fluid density, what other evolutionary factors do you believe led to most vertebrates that travel through the air to use their front limbs for locomotion compared to vertebrates that live underwater to mostly use tails for locomotion. a good example would be seals vs bats, both mammals."
U0887F6V4UX,"Learning about swimming efficiency reminded me of how competitive swimmers swim. I know that the dolphin dive is great for maintaining a relatively high speed and momentum. I believe this is because it imitates how fishes swim, rather than using our arms to stroke forward. It also minimizes drag as there is less surface area as we use less of our upper body to break the surface of water."
U0887F6V4UX,"After quick research, it does seem like tunas have a higher amount of fast twitch muscle fibers compared to eels. This allows the tuna to be faster with more endurance, while the eels are able to maintain a constant speed for longer."
U088N1D569Y,I feel that likely this has to do with 
U0887F68Q8P,"In today's class, we discussed use the dry mass to measure body constitution (% of dry mass) of female yellow eels at the start, after a 5500 km swim, and after 6 months of rest. Are there any deficiencies using this method to study the composition of eel? Are there any other ways to measure and study it?"
U088N1DJDS6,"I mean, airborne vertebrates need to counteract gravity to stay aloft, and front limbs are generally more easily modifiable for generating lift due to their physiological structure. If humans could elongate their forelimb bones, we could potentially spread them into wing-like structures. Aquatic animals, on the other hand, only need propulsion because buoyancy significantly reduces gravity's effect. There's less need to generate upward lift actively, and thus directional thrust is more essential, and tails/hindlimbs are much easier at producing said thrust."
U088N1DJDS6,"We talked about eels and their ability to swim long distances over extended periods without consuming food, relying heavily on stored energy reserves, and barely losing any mass in the process. I was kind of confused about the mechanism in place that allows for such a feature to exist within these organisms. I mean, like the eel in the lab swimming for 6 months and barely losing any fat, protein, or carbohydrate levels is insane. Brian posed the question to me after class, and I wasn't sure what the answer would be. What is it about eels that allows for such prolonged, energetically efficient swimming?"
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Reply) From what I have found, it is a combination of a lot of things that result in an exceptionally slow metabolism and efficient movement. Eels can minimize unnecessary movement, using ocean currents and swimming in a way that requires minimal propulsion; they can make certain systems like the digestive system enter dormancy when they are not needed to save energy; they have specialized slow-twitch muscle fibers that are highly efficient. Also, what we saw from the paper was that they only lost a bit of fat—eels have an almost exclusively fat metabolism which is much more energy dense/efficient than any molecule. In terms of their movement, their bodies are also highly streamlined and minimize friction to reduce drag, and their undulatory movement requires very little energy while also allowing for easy constant motion so that slow-twitch fibers can be used."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) I thought that the use of Von Karman vortices by the trout for passive movement was extremely interesting; other than behind rocks in rivers/streams, where else can these vortices be found in nature, and what organisms use them?"
U088FCLC7PG,"(Discussion) I am also taking Deep Sea Biology currently, and after class today, I watched a video of a Dumbo Octopus move in the ocean. This animal uses its fins, which are on its head, to move as opposed to its posterior"
U088FCLP61L,One question I had was regarding the determination of animals to use different locomotion styles. Obviously this stems from 
U088N1D569Y,I found an article that talked about the different factors of speed in eels - amplitude and frequency - but also introduced an extra factor of tail angle. The researchers
U088QGKHJ20,"Aquatic locomotion varies significantly across different species, with body shape playing a crucial role in propulsion efficiency. Anguilliform swimmers, like eels, rely on full-body undulation to generate thrust, while carangiform swimmers, such as trout, use only the posterior part of their bodies for movement. In contrast, ostraciiform swimmers, like boxfish, primarily use their fins for propulsion, minimizing body movement. These biomechanical principles highlight how different species have evolved unique adaptations for movement in aquatic environments. How might these locomotion strategies influence ecological niches and predator-prey interactions?"
U088QGKHJ20,"Von Karman vortices show up in a lot of places in nature besides just behind rocks in rivers. In the ocean, I would imagine they can form (on a much larger scale) behind islands or coral reefs. Even birds like geese flying in a V formation, take advantage of similar air currents to make flying easier. It’s really cool how different animals have figured out ways to use these natural patterns to move more efficiently."
U088QGJBE0L,In class we discussed how tuna are relatively inefficient in their swimming and compensate using an elevated metabolic rate. I wonder what other mechanisms marine animals use to overcome relatively inefficient swim techniques/behaviors? 
U088QGJBE0L,Another example of the formation of these vortices in air might be behind a mountain or peak. You 
U0887F68Q8P,"One example I thought about is octopus; it does not have a highly efficient swimming technique, but they evolved other techniques like camouflage. Some other animals may have high oxygen delivery systems."
U088FCMFG9L,"I feel like another consideration for tuna especially is their behavior as hunters. This requires them to have significant muscle mass and a high fast twitch fiber to low twitch fiber ratio, which are optimal for fast, powerful bursts of swimming. "
U06DFEQBJRF,"AME4 solution password is “fit”. Should you need a few more days, please just let me know."
U088QGKHJ20,Our discussion today about small particles and looking forward to MP5 made me think about videos like the one I have attached here that became very popular during the pandemic. 
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion) We mainly talked about it in the context of aquatic environment, but I was curious how size/inertia of organisms also affects life in the air. For example, flight of small creatures like insects is radically different from larger birds—instead of gliding, these small organisms need to constantly flap their wings. Why is this the case, and how is this similar/different to life at low Re in water?"
U088N1B170S,"I think this is similar in concept to water in the respect that although bugs do not have to worry about falling to the earth and dying like birds, they cannot produce forward velocity as easily. like you hinted at, this may be because smaller organisms will inherently have lower inertias and need to continually produce force to move. because of this, they need to flap their wings many times faster than birds to allow them to move at speeds that allow them to escape much larger predators."
U088QGKHJ20,"The way I'm thinking about it is that insects and other small creatures need to constantly flap their wings because their small size means they experience higher drag and lower inertia, making it harder for them to glide or coast like birds may. And then considering low Reynolds numbers in water, where small organisms also experience greater drag relative to their inertia they must exert more force to move through a more viscous fluid. However in the lower viscosity compared to water would mean flight dynamics are probably influenced by different factors like turbulence or pressure."
U088N1B170S,"After today’s lecture, I was curious how bacteria or other small lifeforms may be able to take advantage of turbulence created by other larger organisms/environments similar to fish. This seems rather complicated for simple organisms, but may there be some sensory mechanism in which bacteria would not only be able to sense currents, but adjust their motion accordingly?"
U088FCMFG9L,"After our lecture today, I was wondering how lung size could impact the distance that respiratory droplets could travel? Could someone's physical activity level (which would impact lung capacity/aerobic capabilities) play into this?"
U088N1D569Y,"We talked about how dry warm climates like the desert can cause more evaporation, leading to droplets traveling further - however this made me think about how "
U088N1DJDS6,"I think the size and speed do play a role in how these respiratory particles interact wit different surfaces, but it is within the surfaces themselves that dictate how and what happens to these particles when they are introduced to the surface. Hydrophilic surfaces like shirt fabric can absorb and adhere these droplets, while hydrophobic surfaces like plastic or metal can allow the droplets to spread out and potentially re-release smaller aerosol particles if disturbed. Other than that, these high-velocity sneezes could also lead to higher chances of fragmentation upon surface contact, creating smaller particles that remain airborne longer afterward."
U088FCLC7PG,"(Discussion) In class today, we discussed how the motion of droplets is governed by factors such as drag, gravity, size, and velocity, with small droplets remaining suspended for a longer period of time. How do you think external airflow, such as ventilation systems or outdoor wind alter the settling patterns of such particles? For example, how would air currents in a well-ventilated indoor space compare to the stagnant air in an enclosed area?"
U088N1DJDS6,"(Discussion) In the TED talk video, there was an organism that propelled itself via a grappling mechanism, and I was just super fascinated by that adaptation. What makes this unique mode of transportation better than something like the corkscrew movement of a sperm or the beating flagella of other microscopic organisms, particularly when considering environments dominated by viscous forces and negligible inertia? What environmental conditions might favor grappling more than swimming in these low Reynolds numbers?"
U0887F6V4UX,"Discussion: In class today, we learned different movement mechanisms of very small organisms. For example, a sperm moving like a corkscrew was pretty interesting to me since not a lot of people know this. I wonder if there are examples of other organisms that move the same way as a sperm cell does?"
U0887F6V4UX,"This is a very interesting question. I'm not sure what the answer is to this, but I would assume there is not much affect to the distance respiratory droplets travel. Whether it is an objectively fit athlete or a baby, I think the distance of let's say a sneeze molecule would be pretty similar."
U0887F68Q8P,"Discussion: If we want to generate the model related to extremely small organisms and conduct computational research on them. What should be considered during the data collection part? Usually, we might use secondary data other's conducted, but what kind of data is better fit for us to select? If there's no relevant data, could prediction or modeling to 'make up' data be a potential way?"
U089ARFS08G,"That's actually a great question and from my knowledge, you would need objective data about their environment such as the temperature, pH levels, their prey/predator, and depending on how small the organism is, you'd need biological details on a molecular level. Some examples is its protein structure, genomic sequences, and potentially its metabolic pathway.

If you are unsure what type of data to use, you can use a simulation as it would be a better fit than secondary data. Lastly, if there is no relevant data, predictions or modeling can be used make up data potentially. However, you obviously are limited in the research you want to conduct."
U0887F33HTR,"(Discussion Reply) Grappling can be more energy effective than flagellar or swimming motions when the organism is extremely small (having too little inertia to carry any movement) or the fluid environment is so viscous that movement through it requires too much energy. Additionally, some organisms require greater stability and control if they may be hunting prey or need to stay in certain areas, and the grappling mechanisms can provide this. In comparison, flagella-based movement offers less stability and the organism is more subject to the movement of the fluid. It also goes without mentioning that for grappling to be useful, the environment must have some surfaces or substrates for the organism to adhere to—this wouldn't be very useful in empty and open fluid environments."
U088FCLP61L,In class we mentioned that a species

U06DFEQBJRF,"Hi All, Please signup for the wing experiments!"
U088QGJBE0L,After some research I found that some 
U088QGJBE0L,In class we discussed factors that would cause respiratory droplets to move farther. I wonder if particular diseases cause specific types of respiratory droplets to form purposefully to aid in infection of more hosts? Or rather if it is entirely based on the size of the invader? 
U088FCLP61L,I think this is a really interesting idea and would also wonder if different languages result in more dispersion of particles compared to others. I doubt that it would be significant difference but would be interesting to see how that affects the differences in particle movement based on how much a language requires vocal changes or pronunciations that would result in more expulsion of particles. I feel mouth size would be less important compared to a fake of mouth openness which could be related to mouth size. In my opinion it would make sense that a larger mouth expels more air because of a greater area. Taller people probably have a great chance of spreading particles from a physics standpoint that would cause the particles to have a greater starting point resulting in a faster final velocity 
U0887F68Q8P,"That is a good question. There are several reasons why the flu season is in winter. Initially, viruses can survive longer periods in cold weather. So even though it might minimize the distance of traveling, bacterias still choose to spread in winter."
U088FCMFG9L,"I think that evolutionarily, diseases over time would move towards having features that optimize infectivity, as this allows the responsible agent to survive and spread. With that in mind, I think that some diseases would cause types of respiratory droplets to form by means of their intrinsic properties to enhance infectivity."

U088FCLC7PG,"(Discussion) For anyone who may want to join Sam and I on our research project, here is a brief introduction of what we might want to look at!                                                              Some dogs are bred to sprint, others are born to strut - but how do their knees (stifle joints) handle the swing of things? Locomotion of domestic canines is highly variable between breeds due to size differences, limb proportions, and musculoskeletal structure. Differences such as these influence key gait components, including joint kinematics such as flexion and extension angles. The stifle joint, which is analogous to the human knee, is critical to canine limb movement specifically during the swing phase of gait. It works to reposition the limb for the next steps! Understanding how stifle flexion varies between breeds may provide insight into how skeletal and muscular adaptations shape functional movement. Our experiment aims to investigate how peak stifle knee flexion angle during the swing phase differs between dog breeds at a controlled walking speed. In analyzing breeds with contrasting morphologies, we aim to explore the influence of limb structure on joint kinematics on some of our favorite vertebrates!"
U088FCMFG9L,(Discussion) Our group was thinking about studying scale and how it can create tradeoffs in terms of flow separation and movement in fluids. We are hoping to find a model organism / group of organisms that we can model in 3-D and test in the flow device used in MP4.
