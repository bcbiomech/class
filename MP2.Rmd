## Introduction

Our musculoskeletal system is pretty handy in permitting us to move, hold, or manipulate objects, including our own bodies. Many vertebrate biomechanical systems make use of muscular force applied to levers in order to resists or overcome these loads. In this MP, we'll explore a classic lever system in the tetrapod body---the forelimb---one of the [3rd-order type](https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/bodyphysics/chapter/body-levers/). Specifically, we'll consider how skeletal geometry and important physiological parameters like muscle length, and mass affect the force output in this system and how much it can accelerate a load.


### First (Lady) Principles

Imagine that you're at the plex and, in an effort to have arms that look as sleek and muscular as our [First Lady's](https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a20837148/im-a-runner-dr-jill-biden/), you start a program of biceps curls. Your job in this MP is to estimate how much mass you can lift (i.e., accelerate) with your two biceps groups. Let's assume the following.

+ All the force to do the lift is exerted by your biceps femoralis
+ The weight in the palm of your hand
+ Your humerus is stationary
+ The elbow joint is a simple hinge linkage with one DOF
+ The flexion of the arm (i.e., curl motion) begins when your arm angle is 10$^\circ$ and is finished at 135$^\circ$.

What we have here, according to a classic concept in physics, is a dynamic equilibrium problem where: if a torque applied is greater than the moment of mass on the lever, the mass of the dumbbell will be accelerated, a situation described by:

$$
 \alpha=\frac{\tau}{I},
$$

where $\alpha$ is angular acceleration (in rad$\cdot$s$^{-2}$), $\tau$ is torque (N$\cdot$m), and $I$ is the mass moment of inertia (in kg$\cdot$m$^2$). The dumbbell has $I$ according to its distance from the fulcrum (i.e., joint) given by:

$$
I=r^2 \cdot m,
$$

where $r$ is the radius (the outlever) of the load and $m$ the mass of the load. This is the rotational application of Newton's Second Law and the basis of our model.

Our task is now to establish how much torque ($\tau$) is generated at the outlever position of the arm system.

## Methods

### A Law to Live By

First we need to know the geometry of your arm lever system. How long is the outlever? How long is the inlever? Assuming the biceps originates just on the [coracoid process of the scapula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coracoid_process) and inserts on the proximal radius, what is the insertion angle and origin-insertion distance at rest right before the curl begins? Be sure to include these dimensions in a csv file with your submission. The file should look like this (replacing your name with mine):


```{r}
dat <- data.frame(outlever=0.26,inlever=0.05,ins.ang=160,orig.ins=0.3,mass=0.02) #mass from below
write.csv(dat,"prof_kenaley_biceps.csv")
dat <- read.csv("prof_kenaley_biceps.csv")
print(dat)
``` 

Have a look at the figure of the arm system below to help you with this. In addition, the law of cosines may be really handy here. It states that, for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, the  angle A is:

$$
A=acos\Bigg(\cfrac{-a^2+b^2+c^2}{2bc}\Bigg)
$$


```{r elbow,echo=F,fig.cap=c("The human elbow lever, essentially a triangle (below) with variable length $a$"),fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/elbow.png"))

``` 

```{r, echo=F,fig.cap=c("A triangle"),label="triangle",fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/cosines.png"))

``` 

 
### Tension Headaches

The magnitude of torque applied to the forearm during the curl depends upon the amount of force (i.e., tension) produced by the muscle. The amount of force produced by a muscle is, as we have discussed or will, determined by how many crossbridges can form. This number can be roughly estimated by a muscles's physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA), a value computed thusly:

$$
PCSA=\cfrac{M_{muscle} \cdot cos(\phi)}{\rho \cdot L_{muscle}}
$$

where $M_{muscle}$ is the mass of the muscle (in kg), $\phi$ is the pennation angle, $L_{muscle}$ the length of the muscle (in cm), and $\rho$ the density of muscle. 

Compute the PCSA of your right biceps by making the following assumptions: 

1. the length of your biceps containing all the fibers is 60\% the origin-insertion length;
2. the density of muscle is 0.00105 kg cm$^{-1}$; 
3. the muscle is nonpennate ($\phi$=0); and lastly
4. the mass of your muscle is approximated by a volume of playdough.

To estimate the mass of your right biceps with playdough, sculpt the clay to a spheroid that matches the volume of your fully shortened biceps. Flexing and cupping the muscle with your left hand helps with estimating the muscle volume. Next, weigh the playdough (if your muscle mass is large enough, you may have to break the playdough into pieces and way them separately). Vertebrate muscle is about as dense as playdough. Record your mass data through the link above. 

If the maximal force output of human white muscle is 20 N cm$^{-2}$ during an isometric contraction, how much force is produced at the start of the extension? Feel free to ignore length, velocity (it's isometric), and time considerations . . . for now. 

### Taking Mechanical Advantage

In a lever system, the torque applied (say by  muscle, $\tau_{muscle}$) is a function of the magnitude of the input force ($F_{max}$, if it's the maximal force as in the above), the inlever length ($L_{in}$), and angle of the input relative to the lever (the insertion angel, $\theta$). In other words, for our biceps:


$$
\tau_{muscle}=F_{max} \cdot L_{in} \cdot sin\theta
$$

How much torque is applied to the forearm at 6 positions from the start of the curl to the end every 25$^\circ$?  Based on this, when is your arm lever system strongest? 

### A Hill-curve to Die On

From this or previous explorations of muscle physiology, we now know that the amount of force produced by a muscle is a function of time (i.e., latency), shortening velocity, and muscle length. Thus, your previous calculations of torque could be a little bit off. Let's consider one of these factors, muscle length, an important part of Hill-type muscle models [@hill1938heat]. We're not so worried about a 20 ms or so delay in peak $F_{max}$, nor do we need to worry about shortening velocity because we're assessing whether an isometric contraction will impart enough torque to move (accelerate) the dumbbell. 

To do this we must establish the relationship between the muscle-fiber length ($FL$) and muscle force ($F_{max}$), also called the force-fiber length factor or $F_{fl}$. Fortunately, the relationship between force and muscle fibre lengths has been approximated for mammalian skeletal muscle by several researchers, including [@Whiting:1999wv], from whence the following comes. It looks a bloody mess, but here it is:

$$
F_{fl}=-6.25\Bigg(\cfrac{FL}{FL_o}\Bigg)^2+12.5\Bigg(\cfrac{FL}{FL_o}\Bigg)-5.25,
$$


```{r fl,echo=F,fig.cap=c("The force-length relationship of vertebrate muscle"),fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("img/fl.png"))

``` 

where $FL_o$ is the optimal fiber length. So, ``What _is_ the optimal fiber length?" you ask. Well, we don't know, not exactly. But, a lot of good experimental work suggests that, for many muscles in many species, it's an $FL$  that is close to 75\% the maximum length. So let's use that, assuming the fibers are as long as the muscle and the maximum length of the muscle is reached at rest (i.e., elbow at 10$^\circ$). As you can see from the figure above, such a value assumes that the muscle is adapted to work over a range of lengths results in favorable sarcomere overlap.

Once we know the $F_{fl}$ we can multiple this factor by $F_{max}$ to estimate how much force is being produced given the muscle's position of the force-length curve ($F_{muscle}$). Therefore, take this equation and write a function in R that you can pass through the $FL$s and $F_{max}$ values at each of the 6 arm positions to calculate $F_{muscle}$.

*Include in your report an R chunk the script that codes this function.*

### Arnold or Urkel?
Now that you know how much torque your biceps can produce based on your arm's geometry, biceps mass and length, what is the maximum mass (i.e. heaviest weigh) you could lift at each position?

Be sure to reference the second equation above to identify which variable for which you should solve. 

The next and last part of this experiment is to test your model. So, skip on over to the *largest building on campus* and test these theoretical calculations. Find a weight of the closest mass for your calculation for an arm angle of 10$^\circ$. Go lighter or heavier until you can or can't accelerate the dumbbell.

Please capture a video showing your attempt at proofing your model Be sure to give it the filename "first_last_plex" Make sure the mass is identified in the video and you isolate the biceps, i.e., no swinging.

## What to address in the report

After you recover, please synthesize your results and findings according to the suggested organization for an MP report. Remember, you must cite two relevant primary sources. You can find explicit detail concerning the organization of an MP report [here](mini_projects.html). 

With this in mind, please address the following:

  1. What are the $F_{muscle}$ values along the six arm position?
  2. What input torques result from the $F_{muscle}$ values? 
  3. How do these torque values compare to the those values computed using $F_{max}$ only, i.e., not considering a force-length relationship? 
  4. For an arm angle of 10$^\circ$, how did your gym testing compare to your model estimations? That is, was it more or less than predicted?
